B0030T0VFC,"[CLS] With coats of gray, white, red, brown or black, these canines are well-suited for any terrain. Wolves are carnivorous canines that vary in size depending on their habitat. They travel in packs led by the Alpha pair. They hunt in packs too; this way they can take down bigger prey. A prey that stands its ground has a better chance for survival since wolves can chase their prey, reaching speeds of forty miles per hour with the help of their specialized paws and body structure. By marking their hunting territory, wolves are one step closer to ensuring their survival and their need for almost two tons of meat per year. To combat the elements, wolves have thick fur made up of two layers. The top layer contains guard hairs which repel dirt and water while the bottom layer insulates their body.

B00126P1NW,"[CLS] A ferrofluid (from the Latin ferrum, meaning iron) is a liquid which becomes strongly polarised in the presence of a magnetic field. It is a colloidal mixture comprising extremely small magnetic particles suspended in a synthetic oil. The particles are coated with a a soap or detergent to prevent them from clumping together. Ferrofluids are composed of nanoscale ferromagnetic particles suspended in a carrier fluid, usually an organic solvent or water. The ferromagnetic nano-particles are coated with a surfactant to prevent their agglomeration (due to van der Waals and magnetic forces). Although the name may suggest otherwise, ferrofluids do not display ferromagnetism, since they do not retain magnetisation in the absence of an externally applied field. In fact, ferrofluids display paramagnetism, and are often referred as being &quot;superparamagnetic&quot; due to their large magnetic susceptibility.

B004VWLDBS,"[CLS] Hog Wild was founded in 1996 and we live by these simple rules: We sell innovative novelty products typically geared to older kids (over 8) and that cross over to adults. We try to be different and dance to our own beat when developing toys and gifts. We avoid competition whenever possible (no board games, no fashion dolls, no flying disks). We don't do gag gifts but do enjoy humor and farting products (we just don't sell them). We're not the brightest bulbs in the warehouse but we do try and often own up to our stupid mistakes. We like things simple because it's easier for us to understand. We're located in Porkland, Oregon and ship all our products from this sometimes inconvenient location. We typically take 3 to 5 days to process an order for our retail stores and we like to get paid on time. If you're a credit worthy retailer, we'll offer you terms. If you're an end user we want you to buy from our website and we value you the most of all. I'm sorry our prices are not dirt cheap but what you find from us, you should not find anywhere else. There are times when we get knocked off but that's life in the toy business. We're always on the prowl for new ideas and look to outside inventors for help. Most of the really good inventors are very hard to find and they are often bar tenders, school teachers, fireman, and other professions not typically associated with inventing. When we find these people, they typically have really clever, never before seen ideas. They are always smarter than we are and we feel very lucky when they license their product idea to us. Fact: The best products we have always come from outside inventors. If you've got a great idea, we'd love to hear from you. If you work at a professional inventing company with fancy presentations and 1,000s of great ideas, you're probably not a great fit for us.

B001O2QW78,"[CLS] Item size in cm (L x W x H): 7,1 x 2,9 x 6,2<br> With bold white stripes, zebras zig-zag. These sleek, striped equids live in the savannah grasslands of eastern and southern Africa where they spend most of the day grazing on grass, leaves, bark, roots, and stems. Each zebra's pattern of stripes is unique. The plains, or common, zebra sport wide stripes on their bodies -- that continue to the undersides -- along with thinner 'shadow' stripes on their hind quarters. Their excellent hearing and vision help them escape predators. They usually live in family groups of one stallion and several mares but often come together in large herds of several hundred zebras. And, once a year, hundreds of thousands of zebras gather to migrate in search of food and water. These herds sometimes mingle with wildebeests, ostrich, and antelope. Zebras tend to be pretty skittish -- who can blame them with all the lions and hyenas around -- and really noisy. Their whinnies, yelps, and barks are their way of communicating with each other. They never wander too far from a source of water and can live about thirty years in the wild. Fun Facts: Zebras have night vision which helps them to keep an eye on their predators.

B00126LYAG,"[CLS] A ferrofluid (from the Latin ferrum, meaning iron) is a liquid which becomes strongly polarised in the presence of a magnetic field. It is a colloidal mixture comprising extremely small magnetic particles suspended in a synthetic oil. The particles are coated with a a soap or detergent to prevent them from clumping together. Ferrofluids are composed of nanoscale ferromagnetic particles suspended in a carrier fluid, usually an organic solvent or water. The ferromagnetic nano-particles are coated with a surfactant to prevent their agglomeration (due to van der Waals and magnetic forces). Although the name may suggest otherwise, ferrofluids do not display ferromagnetism, since they do not retain magnetisation in the absence of an externally applied field. In fact, ferrofluids display paramagnetism, and are often referred as being &quot;superparamagnetic&quot; due to their large magnetic susceptibility.

B00005NK1Z,"[CLS] Here's your chance to prove you are worthy to save Middle Earth. Enter the world envisioned in J.R.R. Tolkien's book Lord of the Rings and become a member of the Fellowship. The goal of the game is to stop the Dark Lord Sauron from winning back the magic Ring, which Frodo has inherited and which Sauron would use to forever enslave the land.  The game is played on two boards simultaneously--the Master Board and the Scenario Board, with each player assuming a Hobbit character and advancing or retreating on the Corruption Line of the Master board. The goal is to stay on the light side of the Corruption Line. There are two double-sided Scenario Boards representing the regions of Middle Earth you'll be traveling through. The action of the game is rather complicated, being dictated by the picking of Event Cards, Feature Cards, Activity Cards, and by rolling the die. You'll soon see that this game is all about cooperation, friendship, and compromise--you are asked to give up valuable cards for the common good of the Fellowship. If you get all the way to the dark end of the Corruption Line, you'll be eliminated from the game.  There is no individual winner; the group scores points as a whole. At the end of the game, points are awarded based on the amount of shields the players have left and whether or not they succeeded in destroying the Ring. Designed by the acclaimed and prolific game designer Reiner Knizia and beautifully illustrated by longtime \Middle Earth\ artist John Howe, the result is thought-provoking game-play and a mystical gallery of cards and game boards. This game is intricate and may be daunting at first glance, but after playing it a time or two, you'll find it challenging, exciting, and wonderful for fostering cooperation in teens and adults alike. --M.

To overcome this problem, he wrote down interesting words on pieces of paper and rearranged them, looking for inspiration. What he hadn't figured into this experiment was his allergies. One good sneeze and any progress was sent flying across the room. Dave decided to glue the words to pieces of magnets and stick them to a pizza tin. Then he got hungry and the now magnetized words made their way to the refrigerator door. Before too long, Dave wasn't the only one rearranging his would-be song lyrics. When friends came over, Dave noticed they started to move the magnets around, amusing themselves by writing the first magnetic poems. <br><br> After seeing his friends having fun, Dave thought he might be able to sell his word kits at a local craft fair. He made up 100 kits and set up shop at Calhoun Square, a mall in the Uptown area of Minneapolis. All 100 kits were gone after 3 hours. That night, he recruited as many friends as pizza and beer could draw and made up more kits--all of which sold as rapidly the next day. <br><br> From these beginnings, Magnetic Poetry has now sold over three million word kits, over one billion word tiles--growing from the Original Kit to a kid's line of kits, to foreign language kits, to Voice/theme kits.

The Mayans lived in Tikal from 600 BC to 900 AD, but little is known of the civilization that thrived there for 1500 years. Only a small fraction of the site has been excavated and investigated. Up to four expeditions plan to further explore the site to excavate and recover other temples and treasures. Each player is the director of an expedition intent on exploring Tikal in search of the secret paths that lead to the temples and precious treasures that have remained hidden for over 1000 years. A player receives his points during four scoring rounds for each recovered treasure and for each temple that he controls. But, both temples and treasures can change hands. The expedition that earns the most points exploring Tikal wins the game. Tikal is for two players and takes about 90 minutes to play.

B001GMX8Z0,"[CLS] <BR> TEKNO BUBBLES are patented, safe non-toxic blowing bubbles that look and act like normal bubbles under regular lighting, yet are unlike any other bubbles in the world. Blue Tekno Bubbles have a beautiful, brilliant glow under UV (blacklight) lighted conditions. Wand not included. Great for Bubble Machines Size: Half Gallon bottle, Color: Blue The key to fluorescence is harnessing the energy of black light - turning invisible light into light we can see. All light is a form of electromagnetic radiation and it has a dual character - behaving simultaneously like a wave and like a stream of particles called photons. The photons we humans can see (the visible light spectrum) is red at one end, green in the middle, and violet at the other end. The colors can be characterized by their wavelength as well as the energy of their photons. Red has the longest wavelength and the least energetic photon, while violet light has a shorter wavelength and more energy. Teknology Just beyond the violet light in the visible spectrum is an invisible ultraviolet light, what is commonly known as black light. TEKNO BUBBLES contain special patented compounds with molecules that emit visible light after absorbing light from an invisible ultraviolet source. When the ultraviolet photons enter fluorescent molecules, some of the light's energy causes the molecules to vibrate. When the light re-emerges, it has less energy and is now within the spectrum of visible light, which in turn causes our patented Tekno Bubbles to appear to GLOW CRAZY WILD! The Staining Question We have found that if people are passing through Tekno Bubbles or are simply allowing the bubbles to settle and pop on them, the bubbles should not stain their clothes. The splatter will be visible in the blacklights until the clothes are washed. Tekno Bubbles could stain clothes when the bubble fluid totally saturates the fabric. This seldom occurs due to the small amount of bubble solution actually present i [SEP]",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41tZn7bQmML.jpg

B000BHBUCO,"[CLS] A light card game where players gain status by going out first. The 80-card commercial deck contains cards ranked from 12 to 1, along with two Jesters. Each card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck. In other words, there are twelve 12s, eleven 11s, four 4s and a single card ranked 1. The lower the number, the better the rank. The deck is dealt out to all players and the object is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. The hand begins with one person playing one or more card to the center of the table. The cards played must all be of the same rank (although Jesters are wild, and may be played with any other cards). Each player in turn must now either play the same number of cards of a better rank, or pass. Play continues around the table until everyone has passed; at that point, the cards are cleared and whoever played the last set of cards leads the next round. After everyone has gone out, the players are ranked. For example, the person who first got rid of all his cards becomes The Great Dalmuti. Players change seat position to represent the new hierarchy and begin another round. The Great Dalmuti is generally played for many rounds.

Put them on your desk and watch them evolve with a new creation with each turn. Put our movies on the wall and enjoy the added dimension of the image to enhance the performance of the sand. Each turn will create a different sand picture. We offer a range of Sand Pictures for every budget and every person. The Screenies are our entry level sandpicture, size 4 x 7. With over 30 scientific principles found in our sandpictures, they make great educational gifts for children. And, with the small size, they fit perfectly next to a computer at work or on a desk at home. You can turn the Screenie both vertically and horizontally to enjoy different sand-scapes. Klaus makes the KB Collection Sand Pictures in his studio in Lustenau, Austria. Each piece is handcrafted with love and attention to detail. He uses a complex, yet beautiful blend of sand which is carefully selected for each frame color. Turn the sandpicture over to watch the battle of the elements: The sand just wants to settle at the bottom, the air just wants to escape to the top, the water hosts the party. The result is the sand trickles between the air bubbles to create fascinating stratifications in the sand mountains. A slower flow of sand will result in a delicate trickle of sand making more dramatic peaks and valleys. A faster flow of sand will make dune shapes. Best of all is you can control the amount of air in each sand picture so you can make the sand fall as fast or as slow as you want with the injector we include in the art. Our sandpictures are educational for children while soothing and relaxing for adults. There are many sizes and shapes to choose from. A sandpicture will do several times a day what mother earth takes millions of years to accomplish. [SEP]",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51e1Qh0yfbL.jpg

The premise is simple, but it allows kids to create fairly complex sculptures in a non-toxic and mess-free way. Using PixOs, children create designs by placing the beads on a grid-like tray. To place PixOs, kids can use either the provided pen, or use their fingers. Once the PixOs have been placed, the child sprays them with water using the included spray bottle and allows them to dry. Once dry, the PixOs sculptures can be removed from the tray and placed anywhere.<P> The Ultimate Design Station requires some assembly, which a parent should be able to quickly do. Once assembled, the station provides many tools that make playing with PixOs even easier. It includes a PixOs sorter and dispenser, which is helpful since the tiny beads are often easy to lose track of. It also features a bendable hose fan, which can help speed up the drying process. This hose fan can also function as a clamp, allowing kids to hold their creations in place and work on them piece-by-piece. [SEP]",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hGVje-1ML.jpg

B000H6CI2K,"[CLS] Ostriches are flightless birds with large legs carrying them to swift speeds. Ostriches are the largest living species of bird. Although they can't fly, they have very good vision and hearing, which means they can sense predators like lions from a great distance and quickly speed away. An ostrich can run up to forty miles per hour. Even if they don't manage to get away, though, their powerful kicks help defend them. Ostrich live in nomadic groups of up to fifty and often travel with other animals like zebras or antelope. They usually eat the seeds and nuts dropped when they rip the leaves and branches off of trees but are not above munching on locusts or other animals' leftovers. Since they don't have any teeth, they swallow small rocks to help them digest their food. As long as they have access to plants, they can go without water for a long time. (They do like water though, and really enjoying taking baths to cool off in the hot African sun.) Some ostriches live for seventy years!

B0018PWWYS,"[CLS] Hog Wild was founded in 1996 and we live by these simple rules: We sell innovative novelty products typically geared to older kids (over 8) and that cross over to adults. We try to be different and dance to our own beat when developing toys and gifts. We avoid competition whenever possible (no board games, no fashion dolls, no flying disks). We don't do gag gifts but do enjoy humor and farting products (we just don't sell them). We're not the brightest bulbs in the warehouse but we do try and often own up to our stupid mistakes. We like things simple because it's easier for us to understand. We're located in Porkland, Oregon and ship all our products from this sometimes inconvenient location. We typically take 3 to 5 days to process an order for our retail stores and we like to get paid on time. If you're a credit worthy retailer, we'll offer you terms. If you're an end user we want you to buy from our website and we value you the most of all. I'm sorry our prices are not dirt cheap but what you find from us, you should not find anywhere else. There are times when we get knocked off but that's life in the toy business. We're always on the prowl for new ideas and look to outside inventors for help. Most of the really good inventors are very hard to find and they are often bar tenders, school teachers, fireman, and other professions not typically associated with inventing. When we find these people, they typically have really clever, never before seen ideas. They are always smarter than we are and we feel very lucky when they license their product idea to us. Fact: The best products we have always come from outside inventors. If you've got a great idea, we'd love to hear from you. If you work at a professional inventing company with fancy presentations and 1,000s of great ideas, you're probably not a great fit for us.

Wolves are carnivorous canines that vary in size depending on their habitat. They travel in packs led by the Alpha pair. They hunt in packs too; this way they can take down bigger prey. A prey that stands its ground has a better chance for survival since wolves can chase their prey, reaching speeds of forty miles per hour with the help of their specialized paws and body structure. By marking their hunting territory, wolves are one step closer to ensuring their survival and their need for almost two tons of meat per year. To combat the elements, wolves have thick fur made up of two layers. The top layer contains guard hairs which repel dirt and water while the bottom layer insulates their body.

B000F8J3Y6,"[CLS] Hog Wild was founded in 1996 and we live by these simple rules: We sell innovative novelty products typically geared to older kids (over 8) and that cross over to adults. We try to be different and dance to our own beat when developing toys and gifts. We avoid competition whenever possible (no board games, no fashion dolls, no flying disks). We don't do gag gifts but do enjoy humor and farting products (we just don't sell them). We're not the brightest bulbs in the warehouse but we do try and often own up to our stupid mistakes. We like things simple because it's easier for us to understand. We're located in Porkland, Oregon and ship all our products from this sometimes inconvenient location. We typically take 3 to 5 days to process an order for our retail stores and we like to get paid on time. If you're a credit worthy retailer, we'll offer you terms. If you're an end user we want you to buy from our website and we value you the most of all. I'm sorry our prices are not dirt cheap but what you find from us, you should not find anywhere else. There are times when we get knocked off but that's life in the toy business. We're always on the prowl for new ideas and look to outside inventors for help. Most of the really good inventors are very hard to find and they are often bar tenders, school teachers, fireman, and other professions not typically associated with inventing. When we find these people, they typically have really clever, never before seen ideas. They are always smarter than we are and we feel very lucky when they license their product idea to us. Fact: The best products we have always come from outside inventors. If you've got a great idea, we'd love to hear from you. If you work at a professional inventing company with fancy presentations and 1,000s of great ideas, you're probably not a great fit for us.

As you would expect, it is the king of the animal kingdom out on the African grasslands. What characterizes it is doubtless its enormous trunk, its large ears which it uses to cool itself down and its huge tusks. The trunk is actually an extension of the elephant's lip and nose, enabling it to communicate, to bring water and food to its mouth, to pull and carry branches and to make sounds. Its tusks are made of ivory and enamel and are actually two teeth which are used as a tool and as a means of defence during combat. The elephant lives in a herd of around 20 individuals and spend most of its time looking for food. It mainly eats leaves and branches from bushes or trees, fruit or bark. As an age-old symbol of wisdom, it is also well known for its intelligence and its memory, hence the expression to have a memory like an elephant.

B001O2QW6O,"[CLS] With bold white stripes, zebras zig-zag. These sleek, striped equids live in the savannah grasslands of eastern and southern Africa where they spend most of the day grazing on grass, leaves, bark, roots, and stems. Each zebra's pattern of stripes is unique. The plains, or common, zebra sport wide stripes on their bodies -- that continue to the undersides -- along with thinner 'shadow' stripes on their hind quarters. Their excellent hearing and vision help them escape predators. They usually live in family groups of one stallion and several mares but often come together in large herds of several hundred zebras. And, once a year, hundreds of thousands of zebras gather to migrate in search of food and water. These herds sometimes mingle with wildebeests, ostrich, and antelope. Zebras tend to be pretty skittish -- who can blame them with all the lions and hyenas around -- and really noisy. Their whinnies, yelps, and barks are their way of communicating with each other. They never wander too far from a source of water and can live about thirty years in the wild. [SEP]",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31Y5IPFfB7L.jpg

We offer a range of Sand Pictures for every budget and every person. The Wall Type Movies are 13 x 8.5 and are perfect for the desk at home or the office. This size of Movie makes great wall art but can also be put on a table (all hardware included). The Aurora Borealis is a fantasy. The falling sands seem to set the Northern Lights alive as they fall to make mountains, valleys and dunes. Prominent sands are turquoise, blue, black and white. Watch the video on YouTube. Keywords Pitkin Stearns Aurora Borealis. Klaus makes the KB Collection Sand Pictures in his studio in Lustenau, Austria. Each piece is handcrafted with love and attention to detail. He uses a complex, yet beautiful blend of sand which is carefully selected for each frame color. Turn the sandpicture over to watch the battle of the elements: The sand just wants to settle at the bottom, the air just wants to escape to the top, the water hosts the party. The result is the sand trickles between the air bubbles to create fascinating stratifications in the sand mountains. A slower flow of sand will result in a delicate trickle of sand making more dramatic peaks and valleys. A faster flow of sand will make dune shapes. Best of all is you can control the amount of air in each sand picture so you can make the sand fall as fast or as slow as you want with the injector we include in the art. Our sandpictures are educational for children while soothing and relaxing for adults. There are many sizes and shapes to choose from. A sandpicture will do several times a day what mother earth takes millions of years to accomplish. [SEP]",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/516fJZPDtqL.jpg

Immediately he photographed everything that he loves to make disappear when he is haunting including himself, of course. Unfortunately, the enchanted camera takes many photos in the wrong colors. Sometimes the green bottle is white, at other times it's blue. Looking at the photos, Balduin doesn't really remember any more what he wanted to make disappear next. Can you help him with his haunting and quickly name the right item, or even make it disappear by yourself? If you grab the right items quickly, you have a good chance of winning. In Geistesblitz, five wooden items sit on the table waiting to be caught: a white ghost, a green bottle, a cute grey mouse, a blue book and a comfortable red chair. Each card in the deck shows pictures of two objects, with one or both objects colored the wrong way. With all players playing at the same time, someone reveals a card, then players grab for the &quot;right&quot; object but which object is right? If one object is colored correctly say, a green bottle and a red mouse then players need to grab that correctly colored object. If both objects are colored incorrectly say, a green ghost and a red mouse then you look for the object and color not represented among the four details shown. In this case you see green, red, ghost and mouse, so players need to grab the blue book. The first player to grab the correct object keeps the card, then reveals the next card from the deck. If a player grabs the wrong object, she must discard one card previously collected. Once the card deck runs out, the game ends and whoever has collected the most cards wins.

Under the care of an overly strict duchess who forbids dancing, singing and anything that makes them happy, the girls' future looks bleak until the princesses discover that twelve special books bequeathed to them by their late mother open the gateway to a magical world where wishes are granted and dancing is celebrated.

Air Kicks Walkaroo JR Stilts are easier to learn, easier to use, more ergonomically correct, and more FUN! Most stilts are simply straight poles with foot platforms attached to the sides. The tops of the poles rest behind the shoulders, forcing the upper body to slump forward. Not these! Walkaroos have an S-bend which wraps comfortably around the shoulders, allowing you to remain upright for easier walking. Very similar to the Original Walkaroo Stilts, this sturdy aluminum model is lighter in weight, adjusts to three different heights, and costs less. Their light weight makes them easier to carry and quick to maneuver, even for younger children. Perfect for anyone under 110 lbs. (teens or kids, from age 5 and up), the ergonomically correct design of Walkaroo allows a stilt-ist to walk in a more natural, upright position that encourages active play (and teaches balance). As kids gain balancing skills, they can move the footrests higher for more challenge. Walkaroo JR feature non-marking, no-slip rubber feet and footrests, and comfortable foam cushioning on the handles and shoulder rests.<br><br> Maximum rider weight is 110 lbs. Geospace model #11112.

They brought their experience in this field into a special unit which, as Sonderkommando 9, was responsible for the development of tailless all-wing aircraft. The development of the machine known as the Horten Ho IX, equipped with two BMW 003A-1 jet engines began in 1942. Whereas the first machines could only be made as gliders due to difficulties with the jet engine, the second prototype received a Jumo 004B-1 engine. In 1944 the V2 made its first flight reaching speeds of over 780 km/h. The production of the Horten was transferred to the Gothaer Waggonfabrik and the designation was changed to the Go 229. The first machine from the Gothaer Waggonfabrik, the Go 229 A-O V3 received a Jumo 004-C engine. [SEP]",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51iZ3%2BBsUsL.jpg

Creations take shape on a large, plastic workstation that features a removable pegboard. By tracing around the pegs with the pen, kids can weave the string into the shapes of necklaces, bracelets, heart shapes, or stars. Because the pens contain glue, the string stiffens in half an hour into jewelry you can wear or display! <P>  <b>Custom Jewelry and Decorations Galore!</b><br> Featuring 20 paper pattern overlays, two miniature dolls, and a mold for making rings, this activity set will stimulate kids' creative imaginations. An included key chain lets kids take their string dolls with them wherever they go, and two blank pattern pages challenge them to create a string design from scratch. Because each of the four included pens contains a different color of string, kids can simply retrace their designs for a multi-colored masterpiece! <P>  <b>Clean and Reuse the Workstation, Again and Again</b><br> While the string creations depend on glue to hold their shape, parents can rest assured that this activity set won't leave a sticky mess. The string is mostly dry, and any leftover residue on the workstation can be removed with a little soap and warm water. The workstation also features an internal compartment that is designed to hold all the pens, patterns, and pieces, so kids can tidy up the room after they're done. The workstation's convenient carrying handle makes it portable, too, so kids can easily take it to a friend's house.<P>  When using the activity set for the first time, younger children may require the help of an adult to understand the instruction manual. Additionally, because the string has a tendency to harden inside of the pens, adults can help by pulling the strings to loosen them when necessary. <P>  <b>What's in the Box</b><br> Workstation, blue overlay, pegboard, string cutter, ring form, bonus key chain, four string pens, two dolls, 20 patterns on paper, eight curve forms, two pairs of eyes, and instruction manual.

B002ZHJAYS,"[CLS] This is the largest Jigsort in the Jigthings range and it will accommodate most puzzles up to 1,500 pieces - sizes up 36 inches x 26 inches Jigsorts are the ultimate jigsaw puzzle management system - they are the most expensive on the market but unquestionably the best. The system is designed to make it quick and easy to pack away, carry and store your jigsaws; they are forever kept safe, neat and tidy. Puzzle enthusiasts usually refer to Jigsorts as puzzle organizers because each one consists of three key elements as follows: Firstly, there is a firm Construction Board (a Jigboard made from rigid board not cardboard) that weighs 6lbs and on which the puzzle is made. The board is completely covered in a special soft fabric that makes it a joy to work with. It can be placed on any table or shiny surface without the least fear of scratching. The fabric covering keeps the pieces attached to the surface and this, combined with a raised edge around the board, ensures that individual pieces are never lost. Whilst a jigsaw is being made the board is taken out of the outer case to make it easy to move around. Secondly, there are 4 Sort Trays that provide a means to store the non-assembled pieces. The Sort Trays are covered in the same special soft fabric as the Construction Board and if required each one can be used for assembling small sections for later transfer to the main board. The third element is the stylish outer case into which the above items containing your part-assembled jigsaw are packed away. The case has a zip to ensure that no pieces can be lost and an integrated, fully stitched handle (no rivets, screws or staples) enables you to safely transport your jigsaw from room to room, or place to place.

B000HZCZ6U,"[CLS] Klaus Boschs KB Collection (formerly Rainbow Vision Sand Pictures) are interactive, ever-changing, mesmerizing and versatile art pieces. Put them on your desk and watch them evolve with a new creation with each turn. Put our movies on the wall and enjoy the added dimension of the image to enhance the performance of the sand. Each turn will create a different sand picture. We offer a range of Sand Pictures for every budget and every person. The Screenies are our entry level sandpicture, size 4 x 7. With over 30 scientific principles found in our sandpictures, they make great educational gifts for children. And, with the small size, they fit perfectly next to a computer at work or on a desk at home. You can turn the Screenie both vertically and horizontally to enjoy different sand-scapes. Klaus makes the KB Collection Sand Pictures in his studio in Lustenau, Austria. Each piece is handcrafted with love and attention to detail. He uses a complex, yet beautiful blend of sand which is carefully selected for each frame color. Turn the sandpicture over to watch the battle of the elements: The sand just wants to settle at the bottom, the air just wants to escape to the top, the water hosts the party. The result is the sand trickles between the air bubbles to create fascinating stratifications in the sand mountains. A slower flow of sand will result in a delicate trickle of sand making more dramatic peaks and valleys. A faster flow of sand will make dune shapes. Best of all is you can control the amount of air in each sand picture so you can make the sand fall as fast or as slow as you want with the injector we include in the art. Our sandpictures are educational for children while soothing and relaxing for adults. There are many sizes and shapes to choose from. A sandpicture will do several times a day what mother earth takes millions of years to accomplish. [SEP]",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41PMqcO%2Br1L.jpg

Megatrons jet mode looks a little bit like one of Leonardo da Vincis flying machines. His robot mode, bearing a slightly simplified version of the movie Megatrons intricate armor plating, is reasonably well articulated. Among Megatrons arsenal of gimmick features are electronic sounds and lights, a launching claw that becomes a chain whip, and arms that combine to form a fusion cannon. Initially Megatron was Cybertrons designated Lord High Protector, although eventually he succumbed to his consuming lust for the all spark. Megatrons agenda placed him in opposition of Optimus Prime forcing the latter to rally a militia against Megatrons Deceptions. Megatron was single-minded and monstrously powerful; the Deceptions gained ground against their adversaries, and as a desperate contingency the all spark was jettisoned into space. Megatrons attempt to find the all spark ultimately divided him from his forces and led him into frounceen stasis. [SEP]",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Snv8AN0ZL.jpg

You'll soon find out playing BONKERS, a quick-thinking party game that has players racing against time to hit the 'Bullseye' answers and win scoring chips. Here's what happens. After the Card Reader presents a question, the timer is turned over and the fun begins. The player in the 'Hot Seat' starts blurting out answers, trying to match Bullseye answers on the game card. Quick, think of words to fill in the blank: '(BLANK) SALE'. You might blurt out 'yard sale', 'garage sale', 'fire sale', but are those answers a Bullseye match? Keep guessing until time runs out. In the next round you are asked to name living creatures that begin with the letters 'CO'? The answers roll off your tongue: Cobra, Coyote, Cow, etc. To win scoring chips you must match some or all of the four Bullseyes options provided on the game card. The more Bullseyes you hit, the fewer scoring chips are left for an opposing player to win. So don't waste any time! Keep the answers rolling! There are four different card types to challenge you: Figure out what goes in the blank in What the (Blank)?, form words in Add Ons, use letter hints to search for things in Letter Perfect, and find rhymes in Rhyme Time. It's a constant battle of wits, nerves and concentration. Whether you are playing one on one or in teams - it's fun to go BONKERS!
