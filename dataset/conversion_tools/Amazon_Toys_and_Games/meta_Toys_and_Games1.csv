0486448789,"[CLS] Sometimes you need something new and special that gives you 30 minutes of piece. I used these waiting at the dentist or a graduation or something. They are small so they slip into a bag and cheap enough, especially with the 3 for 4 price on amazon.com . The robots and funny faces are a lot of fun. Probably best at 3-4-5 rather than 2 because the stickers are small.I love all of the great not-licensed-character stuff by Dover.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] Sticker Activity Book my arse. This book is 2 pages of stickers, folded in half and stapled inside a cover jacket. It's not a book, and there are no activities to speak of, except for peeling off the stickers (robot parts) and affixing them to the back page.Oh, and did I mention this is TINY?  The whole book is about the size of a passport (but with less pages) and there is about 4 robots total on the little pages (parts are parts, but I counted 1 head, 2 arms, 2 legs, 2 feet, and a body on each of the 4 pages).So that works out to $1.00 per assembled robot - total ripoff.

Since we gave it away, I cant speak to how easy or hard it is to use but birthday girl was delighted [SEP]"",""[CLS] This in an adorable little kit with many great ideas and a kit to get you started. My 7 year old and I loved making a Pom Pom pup together. The instructions were a little vague and unhelpful at times, but the overall idea was great. For the high price here, it would have been very helpful to have a little bit bigger of a starter supply and a video to help those challenged with the written instructions.My daughter was super excited about getting her Pom Pom pup kit. She worked very hard to earn her money for it. I guess the level of instructions were a bit advanced for her, as they were for me. She had gotten discouraged at one point that we didn't know how to do this. We basically made up our own instructions to finish our first Pom Pom pup, and she hasn't picked it up again.Overall, it was a fun mother daughter experience with some challenge. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My daughter wanted this so badly. So she forked over her allowance and bought it. We've used Klutz books for ages and usually have great success. This one was a bit of a dud. It was really difficult to make the pompoms using the enclosed pompom maker. They kept falling apart and once you've cut the yarn, there isn't any way to fix it except to buy more. I've done crafts all my life but I just couldn't get how they wanted the pompom maker to work. My daughter failed and so did I. When it became unfruitful, she gave up. Since there are others who have made it work, I can only assume we were not doing something right. But if this is for kids, it should be fairly easy.Unfortunately, it has not been touched since the first few tries. [SEP]","[CLS] Pom-Pom Puppies is the cutest breed of pom-pom titles from Klutz.

This is a ball shape with edges formed by 30 rhombi (a rhombus is a four-sided equilateral with two pairs of parallel sides) that resemble scaled-down versions of an Egyptian pyramid done in red.  WikiMy grandson has always had an ability to see shapes and develop them into something original.He has always liked Legos and moved on to more difficult shapes and products to satisfy his artistic and scientific self. For his birthday, he asked for this Ball of Whacks. Well, this has turned into one of his more interesting projects. I think he needs another two or three. He has created such diverse objects as dinosaurs, animals, turtles, sun, stars, fruits, and more artistic objects he has his own names for.To say he likes this Ball of Whacks is a misnomer. He brings it with him, the car, park, friends, wherever. Everyone who sees him with it wants one of their own. He really should get a percentage from the owner.  He tells me he is fascinated with the shapes, to see what he can build. He has the kind of mind that can explore any possibility.The Ball of Whacks Is made up of 30 magnetic design blocks that can be taken apart and rearranged. There does not seem to be any end to the shapes you can make. Accompanying the Ball Of Whacks is a 96 page booklet. This gives you Ideas of what kind of shapes you can make, and how to open your mind. For creative people this is a windfall, and for us, regular folks, it can open our minds from the most concrete manner of thinking to go and explore the possibilities.Recommended. prisrob 05-21-15 [SEP]"",""[CLS] Our family really enjoyed spending hours competing with each other with this toy. I couldn't imagine why they thought it was so fascinating because I don't do well with these kinds of things, but the others did. In fact, the larger, more expensive Christmas gifts were ignored quite a bit of the time because they couldn't stop playing with this. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I know I'm going against the grain giving this only three stars but it is a little frustrating to work with.I've had plenty of hands on tactile 'toys' and this one should have delivered but it really falls short in comparison.The object is to rearrange the pieces to an unlimited amount of variations including 'real' or abstract shapes. The problem is that the magnets are not really strong enough so they tend to slide around way to much to hold a shape. We have made a bunch of star shapes (we being my kids age 6 and 11) but even they are running out of ideas.

I guess the answer really is,It's what ever you want it to be.  I went to my Synonym Finder and here are just a few of the names I came up with. They are all names we have used,most aren't even in the dictionary,and any one of them could be used to describe this thing. Doohickie,dojigger,gizmo,whachamacallit,thingumajig,flumadiddle,widget,thingumabob,are all pretty good names;but the inventor chooses to call it a Ball Of Whacks;so I guess that's what it is. The pictures and descriptions describe it as well as anything But what to do with it is the question. It comes with a small book of 96 pages that describes how and why Roger von Oech invented it and what you can do with it. He describes the very interesting mathematics that is the basis of the shapes of the pieces or whacks.To mathematicians,the Golden Ratio,the 30 sided rhombic triacontahedron ,and such have always fascinated scientists and are found many places in art and nature,and in this ball. The inventor also explains what great creative qualities can be found with the ball. The book shows the inventor with a young Buddist monk creating a sun sculpture.This ball will fascinate anyone who picks it up,be they young,old, inquisitive or simply someone who likes to hold,handle and play with things. As soon as one realizes that reassembling it is not nearly as difficult as one might imagine;then the creative juices start to flow and they try to see what they can form. The book gives a lot of sculptures or forms to make;but in no time ,one wants to try their own ideas. My ball has all the same colored Whacks,(red) ;but it comes in several colors and even in multi colors,where the various colors would add a whole other dimension to the creativeness of Ball Of Whacks.This product is excellently made,will provide endless hours of enjoyment,relaxation and creativeness for anyone who picks it up.

0972428216,"[CLS] Great way to teach kids about money. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My son uses this everyday but really doesn't get the concept yet about sharing and spending.  He just wants to save all his money and not spend any of it.  lol  I was using a ziplock bag for all his birthday money before so this is a good buy for us. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Great tool to teach and I llustrate financial management to kids and adults. I don't use this to actually put money in it. I use it as a tool in teaching financial management. I love how each bank is colored differently (red, blue, green) to be easily distinguished from one another. These do not hold a lot of money, but does hold quite a bit. I relabeled my banks to be 10% Save, 10% Tithe, and 80% Spend (Expenses). I just put a white label on the front of each bank. I love that the banks fit like a puzzle making a hexagon shape which takes up less space and is easy to transport rather than have three separate squares that don't fit so nicely together. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I love the concept of this... I do. And this looked really nice from the picture. But the piggy bank actually separates and the yellow stripe around it is a rubber band... not a fan of it. It just seem like for the price, it should be held together better.Each section does open easily by an adult, but my toddlers haven't figured that out and I don't think they'd be able to do so easily which is nice (it's kept out of their reach so we haven't put that to the test). [SEP]"",""[CLS] We're doing the spend-save-share allowance thing with our nine year old daughter, so I was looking for a bank that would make that simpler. I was a little hesitant to purchase this because it seemed on the smallish size and a little pricey, but it's been a GREAT bank. The bank itself is translucent and slides out of the sleeve it arrives in, so you can see the money that is inside and how it builds up. It holds both change and paper money.The three parts of the bank come apart, so your child can bring the save part with her to the bank or bring the share part with her to local orgnizations (we volunteer at a local animal shelter, so she brings the little share section of the bank with her to the shelter and puts the money into the donation box), etc.It also comes with a little bank book, so your kids can input the money as it comes and goes.All in all, I think this is a great introduction to actual banking, as well as a great way to watch money grow over time. Very neat, and great quality. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Got everything as described and promptly.  THANK YOU AND WILL BUY AGAIN!!!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Newest update: My daughter is now 6.5, and I still think this is one of the best things I've bought on Amazon.  We recently saw one of those horrible ASPCA commercials, and she asked if we could send money to the dogs in cages.  She's got the money, so she gets to make those choices.  I love that about this system.  She has donated money to the WWF twice.  If I were to do it all over again, I think I would just commit to $3 per week ($1 per container) - I didn't think that would add up fast enough, but $2 per week has added up way faster than it needs to, and so she doesn't fully understand scarcity.  Even so, she has a much better understanding of money than she would otherwise, and basically has for as long as she can remember because we started this when she was just 4.  Her little sister is 2.5, I'll be buying another one of these when the younger one turns 4.  I don't think there's anything special about the bank itself (by the way, it has held up perfectly - I was afraid the rubber band would lose its elasticity over time, but it still holds the pieces together strongly), but the system is solid, and one of the aspects of parenting that I actually feel like I'm doing right.---New update:  It's been a year, my daughter is about to turn 5, and I'm still really excited about this bank.  We took her share money and looked at charities online.  She chose to give to the Word Wildlife Fund, which has a cool thing where if you donate a certain amount of money, they'll send you a stuffed animal of the animal that you choose to sponsor.  She's definitely still no expert of money, but she's doing really well for her age, and understands when I say things like we can't afford this, or let's save up money for that.  Great, great purchase.---Update:  We've now had this about 5 months.  She has used her spending money to buy stuffed animals at the zoo (which are super overpriced - but now I don't worry about it, that's for her to figure out!), and we opened up a bank account with her save money.  I honestly am so glad we are doing this.  She has a much, much better grasp of money, and what it means to spend it or save it.  We are going to do the share portion close to the holidays, when I will let her choose a charity.  She already is looking forward to that - I don't know how much she understands yet, since we haven't done it, but she will.  But in the past several months, watching the money grow, opening a bank account, using her spending money - this has been a really, really fantastic item.---I have been wanting to start to get my daughter to think about money, and saving it for what she wants.  I didn't know if 4 was too young (she just turned 4), but she understood immediately that she needs to start holding onto money so that she can buy a stuffed animal flamingo at the zoo.  Additionally, she is super motivated now to do things for money.  I debated whether or not I wanted to have this be a part of our routine - money as a reward, learning how to save/spend/etc. so early - but it has been fantastic.  She doesn't quite grasp the spending and sharing parts yet, but I can tell that she will soon.  I intend to wait until she has a decent amount saved up, then open a bank account where we can deposit it, and use the share money on a charity of her choice.  The book suggests putting the majority of the money into spend and only 5% into the other two, but we do 1/3 1/3 1/3.  Why not?  For now, it's working great. [SEP]",[CLS] A multiple award winner!

1338106376,"[CLS] This is a great little craft/journal. It comes with lots of little stickers to add flair.  The stuff you put on it is like frosting that hardens and looks very neat.  It holds up very well once it's dry.  The journal is a good little journal for writing.  My daughter (6 years old) really enjoyed creating it and was able to do it by herself.  Overall, it's a great way to have a craft and journal. [SEP]"",""[CLS] If your daughter spends all her money on tchotkes at the Scholastic Book Fair, then she will LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this journal.  My 7 year old made an absolute mess of the puff paint frosting, but a more focused or mature child/teen could really make it happen.  Of course, my 7 year old plopped down the stickers and then puff painted around them instead of pressing the stickers into the puff paint.  Following directions would be helpful to get the look on the cover of the journal.  But the beauty is that my 7 year old could have cared less because SHE made it and then SHE wrote in it.  The page prompts are fun, but the highlight is definitely in the decorating at the beginning. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is very cute! Definitely geared towards older girls as it's more of an activity book than a journal. There's a lot of surveys and questionnaires and artsy activities for them to do, more of a fill in diary. The decorating is a lot of fun but it's messy and takes a long time to dry. My daughter's favorite part were the charms. It definitely keeps them entertained and it's a fun keepsake for them when they get older! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My daughter enjoyed decorating this journal.  It comes with a tube of puffy paste frosting  with a decorative rosette tip. It also has very detailed instructions on how to pipe the puffy paste into rosettes or shells and how to apply the charms.  I suggest practicing on a piece of cardboard to get the technique down before decorating the journal.  We had a few mishaps and had to wipe the journal off and start over.  Once applied, there are a multitude of stickers, jewels and charms that can be pressed into the wet frosting.  The puffy paste dries firm, but just to be safe, she displays her journal on a stand so it doesn't get damaged. She's eleven, and she ended up with the  paste everywhere and it's not water soluble.  A magic eraser took it right off  though.  In hindsight, putting down newspaper would have been a good idea.The journal is more of a guided activity book instead of  a free form journal.  There are quizzes and questionnaires, and lists to complete.  It's a very sweet little book and would make a great gift. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This journal is based on the Japanese trend of Decoden (decorating your phone).  It comes with puffy glue, rhinestones, charms, and puffy stickers.  It definitely has a Japanese 'kawaii' (cute) flavor to the decorations.  Note that the puffy paste takes 24 to 48 hours to dry fully, so you might have a really impatient little on on your hands.The puffy paste has a lovely 3D texture and has an extruder tip (ours was caught in the bottom of the side pocket, so look hard if it doesn't come out with the paste) to create the little star pattern (just like cake decorating, only a teeny bit less thick than frosting).  It's fairly easy to use even for small hands but I would still recommend parent guidance.  As well, try to avoid putting it on the edges to make it easier to use the journal and so they don't flake off.  We had exactly the amount we needed to cover the entire front page to look like frosting, and only a little bit left.  It really wasn't that hard to squeeze the bag to extrude the paste.The charms and rhinestones are set into place by putting them on the paste, so have them ready in advance.  The big stickers should ideally go on first and then decorated around.  It's a little bit harder than it looks because things sink into the paste and don't always stay clean, and especially with the stickers, it can sometimes be a challenge to get them unstuck from your fingers and onto the paste.  Once on though, it looks SO CUTE!!  To keep the inside of the book from getting bulky, you'll probably want to keep the stickers on the outside.  The book comes with full color graphic descriptions on how to use the puffy paste glue - they are perforated and can be detached once you are finished.The inside of this book was loved by my 6 year old as much as she loved making the front cover.  There are all kinds of things to fill in, many of them focused on creating positivity (e.g., 30 days of writing the best thing that happened that day).  There are quizzes, drawing pages, hair ideas, etc.  The activities are imaginative, brightly colored, and quite fun.  There are so many cute pages of mini-journaling! Because of the thick board-like high quality paper, they do require care as to which writing utensil you use (or the words will bleed/get rubbed).In all, this will definitely keep little ones busy but also create a keepsake for years to come because of all of the cute things they write.  There are so many little memories stored in the book by my daughter.  I doubt the cover will last intact all those years unless with special care but it will make a great memory  when going through what is written inside. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I wanted to love this but I already have misgivings. For one, there's a bit of advice on page 3 saying that the charms might fall off.  Ummm wow.  Really?  Sure they say to use a strong adhesive but then an adult has to be involved.  So that's a bit of a discouragement.  The charms and stickers and such are cute.  Clearly inspired by kawaii.  This is actually what appealed to me because I hoped it would thrill my granddaughter.The meat of the journal begins on pages 12 and 13 with a quiz. Then there's some fill-in-the-blank type things.  It isn't until page 17 you actually have the space and freedom to actually write a journal entry. And there won't be another until pages 29 and 47.  Yep.  You get 3 whole pages for journaling.  The rest is activities and such.  I wouldn't mind all this fluff stuff if the book itself included more opportunities for personal writing.And maybe that's for the best.  The paper is glossy.  This will limit the types of pens one can use in the book.  Or, and I would highly recommend this, you will want to blot the pages so keep paper towels handy.  Simply have the child write and, before turning the page, lay a sheet of paper towel on the page and turn.With that in mind, you might want to wait to decorate the cover until the rest is filled in.  I can't imaging the bumpy cover will not make it easy to write in the book. *shrug*So yeah, it's cute.  And it's easy to fill up with fun things but I had hoped for more.  Hopefully my granddaughter will love it and have fun tilling it and decorating it.  I'll update this review if she is thrilled.  Otherwise, assume she didn't think it was nearly as much fun as it looked to be. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Little girls love journals and what better than to have a journal they can decorate any way they want. This is more of an activity book, not a journal. Each page has a different activity to be performed. It comes with puffy paste, rhinestones, charms, and stickers that can be glued throughout the journal or on the outside cover. It provides hours of fun and allows the child to use their own imagination and decorate the journal anyway he/she desires. Highly recommend this product.

I have the Pete the Cat stuffed toy and he plays with it while I read the stories to him (and I actually was considering making a shirt with velcro buttons to reinact with the story).  After seeing the puppet, I just had to get it.  It is a nice size and is easy to maneuver.  My only disappointment is that only one of the buttons pops off (it is attached by a string so it won't get lost or disappear in little one's mouth) which I feel won't be as big a hit with the kiddies when reading the story because in the story, all 4 buttons pop off to reveal his belly button, and I believe my grandson will be trying to pop off all of the buttons and become disappointed when that doesn't happen.  I guess I will still make a yellow shirt for the stuffed toy where the four buttons can pop off, and will sew a belly button on the toy as well.  That way, it flows with the story in exact detail and my grandson will be able to reinact.  Thus, that's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I think it will still be a hit with the little ones and would recommend.  I feel it would be great to have in a classroom for a Preschool or Kindergarten teacher story aide.Addendum:  I failed to mention that the shirt does close with velcro, and when opened does reveal a belly button on the puppet.  I discovered that on my own as it was never mentioned when I placed my order to get it.

There is nothing that prevents the use of the plastic standups if they are preferred and should be retained in your set in case you lose any of the figures.The biggest change is the concept of fate as an attribute.  Each character gets a Fate value along with his others.  These are basically re-rolls that can be used to re-roll a single die OF YOUR OWN.  It adds a twist to the game and will speed it up.There are also modifications to the board, On the Desert squares you still lose a life but you also draw a card.

You roll a die, move around a board and collect items to fight monsters in pursuit of fulfilling a quest, or quests.If I were going to play a roll-and-move game it'd be this one.  The adventure components make it a little more entertaining than your average Milton Bradley affair.  It will get annoying though when you find yourself in need of landing on a space just to finish the game and just can't roll the right number. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Love it [SEP]"",""[CLS] The board game Talisman has a well-deserved reputation as one of the best fantasy board games ever made.  I have been a die hard fan ever since picking up the Second Edition boxset back in the late 1980s, and I couldn't even imagine how many hours I have spent vying for the Crown of Command.  I still have all of the Second Edition expansions, from the Dungeon and City up to the Timescape and Dragons, including the cut-out special characters from Games Workshop's White Dwarf magazine.Because I love the original so much, (I ignored the Third Edition, which tried to updated things to make the game more in-line with RPGs including things like Experience Points and connecting Talisman even further to the Games Workshop Warhammer Universe.) it took me awhile to give this Fourth Edition of Talisman a try.  I finally gave it a chance at a local gaming convention and was hooked again.This Fourth Edition takes a basic If it ain't broke, don't fix it approach to this classic boardgame, keeping the Second Edition essentially intact but introducing some of the better fixes from the Third Edition.  The board itself is identical, although enlarged and with updated artwork.  The card text is almost unchanged (including characters who plod off to the discard pile) although none of the original art was retained.Probably the most notable change was making Life a variable starting number, just like Strength and Craft.  Some of the characters start with five (Warrior) or even six (Troll) life instead of the standard four.  The Prophetess, one of the most powerful characters in the Second Edition, has been de-powered a bit.  She can now draw one card, and then chose to either keep that card or discard it and draw another, which she must encounter.  That was a nice edition as in the old version The Prophetess was so powerful she was boring to play.  An additional element called fate counters has been added which allow for the re-rolling of a single die if you pay a counter.  Craft-defeated monsters can also be cashed-in now in the same way as Strength-defeated monsters.Fantasy Flight games has done a tremendous job with the production values of this version of Talisman.  Aside from the updated artwork, the counters are all hard-plastic with the Strength, Craft and Life counters being colored cones that come in 1-count and 5-count versions.  The cards are on laminated cardstock which will last through repeated shuffling and drink-spilling.  Really, everything has gone through a major upgrade.If I had any disappointments with this Fourth Edition they are minor.  The game board itself is too huge, taking up my entire kitchen table, which means that when I pick up any future expansions (of which I hope there will be many after&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Reaper/dp/158994464X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Reaper</a>,<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/The-Dungeon/dp/1589945018/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>The Dungeon</a>and&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Frostmarch/dp/158994691X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Frostmarch</a>) I will have to move to the floor in order to have a space large enough to play. I also would have appreciated it if Fantasy Flight had balanced out the gender ration of characters when commissioning the new artwork.  This was something I wouldn't have noticed except when I was playing with my wife she wanted to play a female character and all that was available was The Sorceress and The Prophetess.  Several characters, like the Assassin, the Thief, the Warrior, the Elf, etc...could have easily been made female in the artwork without changing the game-play in any way.I have great hopes for this new Fourth Edition of Talisman, and hope that great things are forth coming.  I would love to see some old favorites appear, like the Champion of Chaos and the Horrible Black Void, along with some new ideas and expansions. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This was one of the games that started it all! I played it twenty years ago and longed to own it when it went out of print. Kudos to Fantasy Flight Games for reprinting it! I am sure they made lots of old school gamers very happy with this re-release.This is a simple game of roll the dice, travel the board, beat the monster, and gather the treasure. It is not a game so complicated that only hard core gamers can enjoy it. There is little head to head conflict between characters unless you go out of your way to make it so. That does not take away from the fun to be had.Luck may be more important than strategy with this game, but that is half the fun! Newbies may have just as much of a chance to win as experienced players do. So if you are looking for a game with hard thought, long term strategy, this is NOT it. This is a fun family style game of simple adventure.This Edition is excellent. The board is VERY high quality and should last a lifetime. The cards are of a decent stock and do not seem to be the type that will fray at the edges after repeated shuffles and handling. This makes the game worth the price they ask.I have only 2 problems with this game:First, after repeated playings, you may find there may not be enough variation in the adventure card deck. It gets to be old hat. This is easily solved by buying one or more of the expansions to add a greater variety. I bought the Reaper, Dungeon, Frost March and Highlands expansions and love them all! They are ALL Quality products!My second problem is the game time listed in the rules says 60-90 minutes. 90 Minutes is possible, but this game can take several hours to complete depending on luck and the aggressiveness of the players. I have never seen a game go only 60 minutes. This is not an issue to me as when I set down with my friends to play Talisman, I plan to make an evening of it.

The paint did not smudge once it was dry and it was easy to work with.  It removed fairly easily with a make up removal cloth followed by a warm wet washcloth.  I like the ideas in the book, and especially the party cards.  I'm excited to use those for a little carnival I'm helping with.  They look cute, but not overly complicated.  The instructions look easy to follow.  All of the designs look great, however I have found that some better options can be found in various places online.  For example, for a tiger I have found much better designs elsewhere.  As a quick resource to do a nice job while under time constraints I think it is awesome though.

However, by following the illustrations in this book, I was able to come up with some credible designs. Enough that my free face-painting session at a bookfair was well received. I have to admit I gained some confidence in myself, too. The paints are adequate for up to 100 faces ... depending on what you choose to do. I kept my designs simple and small. I didn't attempt the fairy face, though it doesn't look too hard when you have step by step illustrations. The paints wash right off with warm water and soap leaving only the faintest of lines if you don't wash it off well enough. None of the children I practiced on had any allergic reactions to the paints, so I'd say they are mild. However, I did read on the instructions that you aren't suppose to use certain colors near the eyes. It would be interesting to find out why that is.  I also had to buy additional brushes, sponges, etc. because one brush/sponge wasn't adequate. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Nice set with a good book.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] My husband and I love the television show and I have devoured the books so it made sense for us to add this card game to our collection.  While setting up the game, we had no problem but then became a little confused when we started to play.  Not a crisis.  There are videos available on youtube with clear tutorials so we were able to figure out what we needed to do.After playing the game one time, we agreed that it seems like it may be fun but we want to give it another go.  I do like that the game rules allow two people to figure out how to play the game, to get a feel for the various steps of the game, how to earn power (the goal is to gain 15 power tokens to win the game), and what to do in each phase.  There is a recommendation to begin using two particular houses:  Stark and Lannister.  Anyone who is a fan of the books and/or television show will appreciate why these two are a perfect choice for starting.However, the first time we played, we kept referring to the rules and that slowed things down.  This is why we both agree that we not only want to play it again just the two of us but also play it with a third or fourth person so we can get a better feel for the game.  I would like to see if we can find someone who is unfamiliar with the books/show to play with us because I have a feeling that a non-fan may not find the game as much fun.  Then again, I could be wrong. So I am going to give this game 4 stars because my husband and I definitely enjoyed it and I can say with some confidence that our confusion is not indicative of how well explained the game play is.  (We just confuse a bit easily because one of us tends to overthink everything.)

The cards are really nice looking.  I've always found Fantasy Flight Games to make nice games, and this one is no exception.This games is suitable for teenagers and adults so it is not a family game to play with younger children.  Play time takes a while, especially in the earlier games where you are pausing to clarify rules, so make sure to set aside a couple of hours.Overall, this is a really nice game for gamers, especially those who are GoT fans.

Of course, since there are many pathways to victory, there are also many pathways to have victory snatched from you, completely unrelated to your own stupidity.

1938146999,"[CLS] This is a very simplified version of a kick in the door and steal their stuff game.It is played using two sets of dice and some nice counters.  There is the adventurer set that can come up as any one of the classic player character troupes, e.g., wizard, warrior, cleric, etc., and a monster set of dice that come up with a series of potential monsters.There is a set of tokens that keep track of experience, magic items, and bonus points.The objective is to score points, and the further you delve into the dungeon, the more points you are likely to get.But, WATCH-OUT!  If your party is defeated, you score NOTHING that round. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Pretty fun game for 1+ players. I like it best as a solo venture, since with vanilla rules, only one player is in the dungeon at a time. You can house-rule it to support more than one pretty easily, though.The components, especially the dice, are great quality. The use of Roman numerals for tokens may seem gimmicky, but it has a precedent in RPGs: you can codify, say, the number 9 with just 'IX' rather than a 5 and four 1s. When several people are playing, that can be useful.The gameplay is straightforward. The balance shifts from strategy toward luck as time progresses, because this game is really about getting the high score and it's better to retire than to die and lose your points. I'd say the RPG elements, while present throughout, are there more for theme - but they definitely enrich the game.Fun game, cool box, quality components, decent price point, pretty fun solo, and expandable in player count.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] Dungeon Roll: 1-4 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 15-30 MinutesI honestly wasn't expecting a lot out of this game when I first eyed it on the Barnes and Noble shelf.  The box itself just looked flimsy and after unwrapping it from the plastic, I confirmed that it wouldnt hold up from a lot of abuse.  I would have honestly gone for something a bit more durable, though I do appreciate the design and theme behind it.  Once you get passed the rather disappointing window dressing, youll realize just how much meat the game actually has.  Its a bit like Zombie Dice, but pushed to the next level.While there is a lot of luck in how the dungeon dice roll, theres an equal emphasis on how you use your party dice to deal with the bad rolls that may come upand trust me, they will.  Since your companions are each good at dispatching a particular monster, youll have to think a bit as to which dice youll want to give up at that particular moment (once a party die is used for any task, it is discarded).  You might have two champions, a thief, and a warrior in your party for example, and be presented with two chests.  Your first instinct would be to use the thief to open both (warriors, clerics, and mages can only open one), but you realize that you have two dragon dice sitting in the lair and theres a good chance youll be facing off against it soon.  Giving up a champion to open both will still leave you with the three different companion types youd need to defeat it.The above situation is but one example of the choices youll be faced with in this game.  Sometimes you may opt to have a scroll drink a potion in order to revive a champion (you can make the party die anything you want) and others, you may decide to keep the scroll in the event you get a bad roll (three monsters of different types). Tokens score you experience points at the games end, so sometimes its best to bow out early on a delve in order to save them. Then again, one token might be all you need to go two more levels.  Each character also has a special ability, which can be upgraded (by flipping the card over after earning so much experience) and used to get yourself out of some nasty situations.  Theres no shortage of if-then dilemmas here.Despite the poor presentation, I found Dungeon Roll to be a joy to play.  It packs a bigger punch than Zombie Dice, I feel, and I honestly cant wait to get back in there to see how well I can do the next time around. Twenty bucks was a fair price to pay in retrospect, though I do think fifteen would have been more realistic.

The further you go the more experience (this game's points) you receive.It is still a pretty simple press-your-luck dice game but to fill a few minutes this is, like I said, a better option than most because the decisions actually feel a lot more important than whether to just go again or not.

It NEVER ends. Like literally, once you get down to two people, I cannot see any way this game ever ends. And that sucks.

It has held up over the years and makes for some fun game play.It is best played with a younger child (we've done it ages 4 to maybe 8). Each sandwich shaped card has a food item picture. Players take turns turning over their Slamwich cards one at a time. If two cards are the same in a row, the first player to slap the pile gets all the cards in the current pile and adds them to the bottom of their pile. Or if there is one card separating the match, you can do the same thing. There are also thieves that require a loud, Stop thief and a slap. There are muncher cards too but we've never been able to work that into our game, they seem to make it more awkward to play.So the game continues until only one player has all the cards.It is fun seeing some of the combinations of pictures (peppers with jelly side-by-side) and it is fun for the kids to slap the table.It takes moments to learn and can be played for just 5 minutes or longer if you want to drag it out or play again. k [SEP]","[CLS] 2 to 6 Players. Playing time: about 20 minutes. Flip and stack this clever loaf of cards to build slamwiches and double-deckers. Tomato, onion, tomato... slap! Get there first and win the pile.

Parental alert: a sharp eye and fast hand will prevail. Play all out, but the kids will beat you every time! Slamwich teaches reading readiness skills, like visual discrimination and sequencing. While kids are flipping and stacking cards, they're actually learning how to recognize a series, make combinations, and anticipate what might happen.

B00000IRMM,"[CLS] My boys like using it! [SEP]"",""[CLS] So far I'm very pleased with this product. My 6 year old loves it and wants to play all the time--that alone is worth the money, regardless of the durability. And durability is why I give it 4 stars--I've read the reviews and am less than hopeful on its longetivity. However, when I first got it out of the box, I had the same problem as many reviewers--it came on but wouldn't work. When I opened the battery compartment I saw that the batteries were slightly buckled, I replaced them flat and voila, the MathShark worked. It seems like the battery compartment is just the tiniest bit too small for the batteries; if you're having a problem, try repositioning them. The screen is small and not that easy to read, but it doesn't seem to bother my child at all. It's basically like reading a calculator.But other than that, it's great. I think my 9 year old will enjoy it too if he ever gets a chance and I love the fact that it has percentage/decimal options as well.We also have MathSlam which is very sturdy but didn't interest my older child, plus it's so noisy I couldn't stand it. This toy is very quiet. MathSlam is also only good for add/sub whereas this is a toy that can grow with your child's emerging math skills...if it lasts that long.All in all, Im pleased with this purchase. Even if it breaks tomorrow, I feel my child has gotten enough out of it to make it worthwhile. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I gave this Mathshark to my son for Christmas and he LOVES it.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] Bought for my seven year old grandson.  He had loved the electronic dictionary but found this toy below his level.  It did not hold his interest.  It only allows you to drill, like electronic flashcards - there is no game aspect to it so he gets bored fast. I could see keeping this in the car or using it as part of daily homework, but he's unlikely to pick it up and play just for fun.It fits better in an adults hands than a childs, as it's quite bigger. The buttons feel almost old-fashioned, you really have to push them with force to make it register - I think if this was used often, the buttons would wear out. It's easy to figure out how to use it, but once you start one of the flashcard quizzes, there isn't a good way to exit. You have to finish the whole quiz or turn it off to start over on a different skill, which is a bit annoying if you start a quiz and realize it's too easy or difficult and want to change the level.That's about it - a good tool but not a lot of fun.

I was looking for something electronic to help him learn/practice multiplication and division before 2nd grade. The addition and subtraction were way to easy for him.

He could spit out his multiplication tables in 1st grade after using the math shark, but I didn't get the feeling he understood what mutliplication was after using this product.I also don't feel it was good value for what he learned compared to so of teh other products out there.

My students played this game once and were done! They will play other cooperative games all day long, but not this one. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 7 yr old daughter loves this game and it is fun even for older kids and adults to play unlike some kids' games.  It is basically a memory game with a fun twist -- there are 12 sets of valuable objects depicted on 24 cards.  Three of the cards are randomly chosen and placed behind the secret door.  The rest of the cards are shuffled, along with 12 cards depicting clocks, and then all these cards are placed on designated spots on the board.  Each player takes a turn by turning over two cards, trying to find matching valuable objects.  If you find a match, you remove the pieces from the board.  If you don't find a match, you turn the pieces back over and try to remember where they were in case you find either object somewhere else on the board (like a typical memory game).  Players work together and can help each other remember where pieces are hidden.  There are also 12 clocks hidden among the valuable objects.  If you turn over a clock, it is removed from the board and placed on the row of clocks at the top of the board.  The goal is the game is to collect enough matches that you can figure out which three cards are missing (hidden behind the secret door).  Players win if they can figure out the missing objects before all 12 clocks are found.  I would have given this game 5 stars except for the INCREDIBLY poor quality of the game for the price.  The board itself is only 12 square and doesn't even lie flat very well.  The cards are made of super thin card stock with no coating, so they will wear out fast.  And the artwork is very crude.  When folded, the board doesn't even fit well into the box -- we have to jam it in to fit. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The Secret Door is a game I have in my gifted classroom. This is definitely a winner.

I would recommend this game for a gifted classroom and for families. [SEP]"",""[CLS] As many other reviewers have mentioned, the quality of manufacture for this game is really poor. The pieces are made of very thin cardboard with no coating over the image side for added strength/durability, unlike most cardboard game pieces.When you initially receive the game the pieces are all stuck together as part of a thin cardboard page and you have to pop the pieces out. Unfortunately, when popping them out they very, very easily rip and many of ours now have rips on the back. It would be easy for someone playing the game a lot to realize which cards have what ripped backs, therefore taking away some of the excitement of the game (you're not supposed to know what each card is until you turn it over).The game is pretty inexpensive (we paid $12ish for it), but we've bought other games for comparable prices that were far superior in construction (not falling apart day one)Our daughter is  7 1/2 an she likes this game.

To our son, that looked like fun, so he jumped (awkwardly stepped) through a few times.Then we un-did two of the three velcro straps that are used to bind it into a flat shape, and the tunnel partially opened into a half-round, like a macaroni noodle. A dog walked in, and our son was satisfied he could see both ends of the dog depending on what opening he looked through. So he went a few times.Then we opened it up fully, and after mom crawled through he took a few minutes and warmed up to it. What a great way to wear out the little guy before getting ready for bed in the evening. Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over he crawled through.It turns out the tunnel is quite the interactive parent-toddler play device. Throw a ball in. Stick your face upside down on one end. Twist the other end upward so your kid has to pop up as if in a rabbit hole. My wife and I are both constantly amazed how many miles this tunnel logs, but, come to think of it, I remember vividly logging similar miles in my tunnel as a pre-schooler and kindergartener, even without the parent involvement.And, again, the best feature is that is quickly compresses down to nothing and stores out of the way when play time is over.

It goes up in minutes and can be used inside the house, in the child's room even, it's not that big, but very roomy and useful. Also quite sturdy and can be used outside as well. For the price it's a miracle. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 3.5 year old LOVES this tent! He plays with it for hours at a time almost every day since we put it together for him about a month ago. He often plays VERY rough with it, pretending it's a rocket ship and jumping on it, pushing against the walls etc etc and while I've had to adjust an odd strap or two it's remarkable how well it's holding up against his really enthusiastic play. I've been going back and forth between 4 and 5 stars as my son loves it so much he'd probably find a way to give it 10 stars but I just really dislike that there is no convenient way to put it away between play times, so it has to sit permenantly in the middle of his room, and it takes up a large amount of space -- for the footprint it leaves you'd think you'd at least be able to fit one very petite mom in there, and for the $50 price you'd think you could fold it up easily without having to take the whole thing apart. But these are still just my only small gripes about a tent that is WAAAAY more durable than you'd ever expect and had provided my son hours and hours of entertainment. Overall I absolutely recommend it, just make sure you're keeping in mind that this thing has to be completely taken apart to be put away at all so unless you're getting it for a specific use, like a slumber party for instance, you're going to need a large area in your home for this thing to reside! It would work best for those with a playroom that want perhaps a permanent tent set up for a play space, book nook, etc. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My sons got this as a Christmas gift from my mom.

She had outgrown the whole crib set-up but is such a restless sleeper, she cannot sleep on a bed or even the floor without ending up 15 feet away from where she started.  We got this so she'd have a semi-contained area to sleep in.The set-up is pretty quick and easy.  We set it up once at home to test it out before our trip and that's when we found that the string that holds one of the poles together came out of the end piece.  I contacted Pacific Play Tents as soon as it happened as we were only a few days away from our trip and explained what happened.  They sent me out a replacement piece, no questions asked, very promptly and we had the new piece in time for our trip.  Awesome customer service!The size of the tent was perfect for our daughter and it makes for a nice indoor/outdoor play tent or shade for outdoors.  The ventilation is good and the Velcro flaps/door are a nice size. It folds up very easily and quickly and fits nicely into the provided pouch. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This didn't turn out at all like I expected and my husband and I were incredibly disappointed last night (Christmas Eve) when we set this up. I purchased 2 of these tents and the tunnel to set up in the playroom because my 3 year old is obsessed with camping and forts. I thought it would be great for them to each have their own space and the tunnel access to visit one another. The first issue is that there should be an option to buy the tunnel hole on left side or right side. I should have thought of this issue so it's not the company's fault entirely but basically the only way to connect them is with one tent door facing in one direction and the other tent flipped completely around so the door faces the opposite direction. Would be fine set up outside but don't buy these for inside expecting to put them back against a wall because it won't work. The other issue is connecting the tunnel to the tents. One side has Velcro and straps like you're supposed to be able to tie it to the tent somehow and the other side is Velcro only. The tent only has 2 small Velcro squares below the hole that the cover flap hooks to when down so there's nothing that actually attached the 2 together. In hindsight I'm guessing the straps are only for tying the tunnel once collapsed to secure it. We ended up just kind of sticking the tunnel inside the hole opening on one tent and inside the door of the other tent and letting my little girl use the hole for her door but it's a pain in the butt because every time they crawl through it moves. The tunnel is okay on its own and they've crawled through it all day but not a great combo with the tents. The tents were smaller than I expected based on the reviews I had read but they're great size for my little ones. All in all though I'm not sure I would make this purchase again....at least not for what I intended. [SEP]"",""[CLS] 2 different preschoolers have loved this tent and its attachable tunnel.

B00000IWDN,"[CLS] Great product and quality. I like so much. It is a good product and good price I would buy again. Thank you. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My son got this for Christmas we'd only played it a few times and the electronics stopped working which makes the game completely useless.  I wish he'd gotten the one that didn't talk, at least games that don't talk aren't broken and unplayable if the electrical component dies. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Electronic or not, Battleship is a classic, but messy none the less. It's loud and annoying. Learning to play the thing is half the battle. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I just came back from buying the Electronic Battleship Advanced Mission game. First, I bought the one that comes in the BLUE BOX. After five minutes into the game, I could see how badly this game was done. Especially the annoying voice of the announcer that lets you know if you hit or miss a target because not only does he sounds awful but also you just cannot understand what he says. Therefore, if you are playing with the advanced weapons and use the tomahawk missile, when the game announces the spaces that you hit and missed you will not be able to tell the difference between the two no matter how many times you press the repeat button. It was so frustrating that I immediately packed the game and went back for a refund.Then I saw the Electronic Battleship Advanced Mission that comes in the GREEN BOX and I exchanged it for that one. Wow, what a difference! The voices, the sounds, the design, everything is just excellent. Here is what you get in this new and revised game. Remember, it's the one in the GREEN BOX.1. The original game play in a bigger grid (10 x 14), Salvo mission (You fire one shot for each one of your ships still afloat) and Target Plus One Mission, or Bonus Mission (You earn and extra turn for every hit or successful scan until you miss).2. Advanced Weapons can now be used in Salvo and Bonus Missions.3. The voice of the announcer is understandable. You will have NO problem whatsoever in understanding hits and misses.4. The Attack Squadron Planes now move AND scan on the same turn, and the Planes now scan the space immediately underneath them. Beware of the Anti-Aircraft Missile Battery, the only defense against these pesty little creatures.5. The Aircraft Carrier missiles were eliminated. Now the Attack Squadron Planes are equipped with a one-time use only missile that automatically hits every space where it detects an enemy target. It does that on the first target found only, and then it only scans.6. The Battleship has one Tomahawk missile that hits everything in the 3 x 3 square where it lands. The now called Light Missile Cruiser has two Harpoon Missiles that covers three vertical or horizontal spaces. The Fast-Attack Sub has two torpedoes that travel from one side to the other of the grid unless it hits a target first. The Sub also has a scanner that will tell you that an enemy ship is in the vicinity but will not tell you the precise location unlike the Attack Squadron Planes.7. The new design brings the game to eye level but if you must you can place it the conventional way. The ships are redesigned and the place where you store the pegs actually works (you know, it will not open after storage). Plus the pegs will NOT fall of the grid easily.8. The new sound effects are cool and necessary. Before the sound of a missile launching and a hit were too confusing. Now not only can you distinguish between the two but also there are different colored lights to indicated launches, scans, hits and misses.In my opinion, this is a great upgrade to a classic game.  A small screen that will record your latest moves is still necessary. I mean, more than once we have found ourselves forgetting what pattern we choose our planes to scan and the repeat button repeats only the last sentence said. But until then, enjoy this beautiful and impressive Electronic Battleship. It actually made me remember how I felt around twenty years ago when I got the first Electronic Battleship made. I hope you have as much fun as I did then and are having now. Bye.

B00000IWDQ,"[CLS] Considering how few multi-player games exist for very young children, Ants in the Pants is a boon for parents. Unfortunately, it may be more fun for parents than for the youngest kids.Making the plastic ants jump into the pants is fun, but my three year old son found it frustrating, getting no ants in after many minutes of trying. But he was dogged after I encouraged him to practice more. (It's difficult to assist kids in learning how to apply just the right pressure to control the jump of the ant.) After a while he got one in, but by that time he was mentally fried. Since then he has shown little interest in the game.I personally find the game fun, so it's disappointing that my son doesn't. Obviously, you're mileage will vary. My advice is that it might be a better game for kids four and a half and older.The game is fairly well made and the ants virtually indestructable. Other than the fact that you can lose the small ants, the game should last a while.Considering the inexpensive price, it's worth a try. If all else fails and the kids bail, you and the Mrs. can play.

B00000IWH9,"[CLS] Remarkable. Scrabble is cool. Hep. Rad. Outta sight. But Scrabble in this deluxe form is sublime, intoxicating. The pieces stay put, thanks to little walls around each space. You can spin the board so as to not need to examine it upside down. The pieces never slide around. The plastic coating lets you wipe it off, unlike the cardboard version which stains. Nothing is compromised from the original, flat cardboard version, but everything is improved.OK. Not everything. It still can't help you dump the Q, Z and J at the end of the game without a U. And it is unlikely to assist you in stopping your grandmother's amazing ability to squeeze you out of that triple word score you hoped to grab with a seven-letter word. Take that up with Gram.

You were playing at your Grandmas, and you saw she had this cool version with a rotating turntable, wooden tile holders, nice deep pockets where the letters sit on the board.  You decided to buy one yourself here at amazon. You ordered it, excited to have a high quality Scrabble in your own possession. You get it in the mail, you open the box, thrilled to own Scrabble, but then.... the unthinkable!!  This ain't your Grandma's Scrabble!!  What they have done, is turn a nice idea into the cheapest thing they could come up with and still call it deluxe Scrabble. PLASTIC. Everything is PLASTIC.  The tiles might be wood, I dunno I didn't bite them, but everything else is cheap, thin plastic.  Doesn't turn nice like the old version. And the biggest kicker of them all, is the board itself. Gone are the nice deep squares the tiles would sit in - where even if you bumped into the game or table, they would stay put.  Now it's shallow grooves, and you have to be careful not to turn the board to quicky or they'll move easy.You're better off buying an old one at a garage sale. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My parents have had a Deluxe Scrabble board as long as I can remember (I'm 25).  This board is a step up for a regular scrabble board and looks stylish, but is not near the quality of their board.  The plastic dividers between grids are very short - maybe 1 mm high.  The material underneath the grid (with double score, triple word score, etc. printed on it) seems to raise up and not lay flat against the board.  I do like how each tile holder gives you the # of tiles for each letter.  The board does raise up very high (compared with the old version) when you use the turntable.  All in all, I'm definitely happy to have a Scrabble board for my own house and I will enjoy playing it with my husband.  However, I do agree with the other reviewers that this is a step down from the old board.  A few inexpensive improvements could have made a big difference.

Worth the extra money in my opinion. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We have the standard Scrabble set. But when I played with an old (1980s?) Deluxe Edition Scrabble with raised grids and swivel board, I immediately ordered a Deluxe Edition for myself. But I am greatly disappointed by this new Deluxe Edition.This item in general is of cheaper make than the older Deluxe Edition. The grids are shallow, so the tiles are not securely anchored in each slot--a major reason for my purchase. The turntable as well as the tile holders are flimsy, made of cheap plastic. (If you use the pedestal for the turntable, your board will rise about 4 to 5 inches above your table!) For [money amount], one'd think that MB would be able to maintain the quality of this classic game, if not improving upon the older version.That being said, this version still will perform better than the standard edition. So if you want a brand new Scrabble game, this is definitely the one to get. And, if you play on the floor a lot, maybe you actually will like the high-platform game board.

Each space is surrounded by a raised ridge that keeps the tiles from sliding on the board.What this edition does not have is the special tile racks that were in the original Deluxe Edition.  These racks had a peg system on the top for keeping score (a feature I really liked as no one could say that we should not keep score because they couldn't find a pen).  This edition comes with more standard tile racks (the wood ones).Overall, a wonderful way of playing this classic game (although the special board does not fold so the box is bigger than the original).  I just wish they had included the special racks when this was reissued. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The deluxe edition of Scrabble completely surpasses the general version.  If you play Scrabble with any frequency, you will enjoy this edition so much more than the cheaper version.As everyone knows, the grids keep the tiles in place and the board rests atop a lazy Susan which allows you to spin the board around as each player gets to his or her turn.I've played with several variations of the deluxe edition, dating back a few decades.  In the older versions the board was raised only an inch or so which meant that if someone's rack of letters was nearby it would likely get clipped by the board.  This was an annoying drawback to the board.  The most recent edition, however, has been improved.  The board is now raised a little higher so that it is above the height of each player's rack.  Also improved was the base itself which allows for storage of  all the letters and the racks.Also improved is the top surface of the board.  Every older deluxe version I've played on had an annoying clear plastic which reflected bright light.  This new version has a more subdued texture which is far more pleasing to the eye and has very little if any glare.  I'm not sure if I'm using a different version or not, but I have to disagree with those who say this new surface is vulnerable to spilled liquids.  The edition I'm using (which is only one year old) is a kind of plastic that will withstand just about anything spilled on it.The only drawback I've seen is that the board, while better designed, just feels a little more cheap than previous editions, possibly because of its reduced weight.  Other than that, I highly recommend the deluxe edition. [SEP]","[CLS] For over 50 years, Scrabble has turned normal families into shouting, squealing, laughing word enthusiasts!

B00000JBLD,"[CLS] In shopping for puzzles over the last few years I've noticed that the manufacture's age recommendations seem to be a bit off.  When puzzles are too advanced, the simple solution is to put it up for a later date; however, when they are too simple, they're a waste of money.  Unfortunately, the Alphabet Art Puzzle was one of those disappointments.The puzzle encourages thinking, and matching, but I'm not sure it helped to teach the alphabet.  In addition, some of the images are too goofy for this age group.  For instance, a piece of Rope is shaped into the letter R, but a 3-year old don't associate with such a thing.  Another example of this, is the letter Y for Yarn.  Wouldn't a Yo Yo be a better solution?  The raised pieces do offer a new motor challenge from plastic knobs, but they are too shallow for the board.  I can't seem to move this puzzle without dropping several pieces on the floor.  My son found this frustrating as well.What's more, I think the age recommendation needs to be adjusted.  I purchased the Alphabet Art Puzzle when my son was 2-years and 4-months old.  It's recommended for children 3-years and up, so I thought it would make a good choice.  It didn't challenge him at all.  The second time he worked it, he completed it in less than 4-minutes by himself.  That said, my son has benefited from the puzzle.

I put *puzzle* in qoutes because at the time that toddler is interested in letters (~2.5 years for us) this is a very easy puzzle.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] There's one thing simple about this gamethe rules. In fact, the rules can be explained in a couple minutes (at most). But this isn't a simple game. It's a highly strategic game, requiring an ability to strategize several moves ahead if one is to have a realistic chance of winning. Just as chess requires not only planning one's own moves but trying to anticipate how one's opponent is going to react to one's moves, so too with Quoridor. Without the ability to do this one doesn't have a realistic chance of winning, particularly if one is playing against multiple opponents.

Room for very deep strategy, yet fun strategic discoveries are accessible even at beginner levels. Beginners correctly feel they understand enough to make respectable moves and to create problems for the opponent. Surprising turns of advantage can occur.Both players get 11 pieces: 1 pawn plus 10 fences. Each turn you move your pawn of place a fence. To win, get your pawn from the north edge to the south edge, while your opponent tries to get his pawn from south to north. You are not allowed to create an impenetrable complete chain of fences. Thus sometimes you place a fence to seal all but one remaining opening for your pawn, making it illegal for your opponent to block your pawn's path out -- which sometimes takes you unstoppably to your winning destination!At times you can make a move that looks terrible for you to the eye yet is a winning move. What is visually happening on the board translates very well to an impression of the strategic effects of the moves, somewhat like Twixt.Chess players will immediately recognize a loose analog of king opposition in chess endgames, and will feel similar issues surrounding immobility. Unlike chess or Khet, you never suffer a discouraging and probably permanent material deficit.Playing Quoridor gives me a feeling that is a hybrid of what Twixt and Chess make me feel.Khet is another great game I have yet encountered with this elegance and the other attributes at the same superb level as Twixt and Quoridor. Quoridor has fewer blunders than Khet (blunders in Khet feel much less forgivable than in chess, yet are more frequent in Khet than in chess). Quoridor is a Wow.My wife knows nothing about games. Yet as a gift for me, my wife chose Quoridor over Quarto, even tho the games shop owner slightly recommended Quarto over Quoridor. She said Quoridor looked more like a board game with some animation to it.My wife and daughter both immediately wanted to play a second game. Excellent durations of approx 15-20 minutes. Pleasant to touch, made of wood, not plastic. Opportunities of clever moves. For 2 or 4 players (not 3, not 2-4 as the game box misleads).At www .quoridor .net you can play against a computer in pseudo-3D, for free. Play against its strongest level. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The rules for Quoridor are a paragraph long. You can understand everything you need to play the game in just a few minutes of watching someone play. The whole game takes five, maybe ten minutes. And yet it's completely absorbing, deeply challenging, often surprising, uniquely compelling.The game is played on a 9x9 grid. Deep channels separate the squares. These channels are deep enough to hold a wall - a thin wooden rectangle wide enough to span the border of two squares. Each player has a wooden pawn. The object of the game is to be the first player to advance her pawn to the opposite side of the board. Each player, in the two-player version, also gets ten walls. On your turn you can either move your pawn one square horizontally or vertically, or you can add a wall. These two choices seem remarkably familiar, elegantly embodying a fundamental political dynamic: to advance our own cause, or to prevent the opposition from advancing. The result of this debate is the creation of an evermore complex maze, again depicting something remarkably familiar to anyone engaged in political discourse. Republicans, democrats, lovers, parents, children.As Rob Solow reports, Quoridor is such an elegant game that it can be easily played (with some minor modifications) with a 5-year-old. And that is another important thing to note about Quoridor - because it is so easy to understand, because it's components are so few and so functional, it is also easy to modify. Like tic tac toe, Quoridor invites you to come up with new ways to play. Rob talks about giving the weaker player more walls. Since you can play several games in a half-hour, it is easy to create a handicapping system where the losing player gets two more fences for the next round.Quoridor comes with four different-color pawns. In the four-player version, each player gets five wall pieces, and the pawns start out in the center of the board rather than on the opposite ends. This points to yet another variable - the starting position of the pawns. Then there's the rule for what happens when two pawns meet. In the standard rules, they get to jump over each other. But that, clearly, is only the beginning. And one can't help but gleefully contemplate the implications of a two-player version with four pawns.Quoridor exemplifies the kind of thinking game that prompted the creation of the Major FUN award. It can be intensely competitive, but its elegance and brevity make playing the game itself fun, no matter who wins.Designed by Mirko Marchesi, Quoridor is another beautifully rendered wooden game from Gigamic, available in the US through the wise auspices of Fundex Games.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] When I ask you to identify a board game that is a strategic puzzle game for two players that also involves dexterity, what game pops into your well-informed head? Would it, perhaps, be Batik?You know, Batik, that lovely, wooden, puzzle-looking game in the Gigamic collection - yes, that collection of wooden strategic games available in the US from Fundex Games.Batik, the puzzle game designed by Kris Burmin, in which two players take turns dropping two different colors of wooden, tangram-like pieces into a wood and plexiglass frame.One of the most self-explanatory games around, especially for those who've played Connect Four. Even those who've played with Connect Four, just to see what happens, like a checker-dropping 3-year-old.See, when it's your turn, especially in the beginning of the game, it's not just a question of dropping any old shape into the frame. First of all, you have to pick a strategically significant shape (big? pointy? tiny? smooth?), and you have to get it to land pretty much just where you want it to land, somewhere preferably snug, or not, 'cause you often win by taking up more, rather than less space. And there's just a tad of luck, too. Taking turns, using any piece you want (unless you're playing the official use only your own piece version), making sure that you're not the player whose piece doesn't fit ertirely within the frame.Not that I'm recommending you should, but nonetheless gleefully noting that Pete Hornburg figured out how to get all the pieces to fit perfectly inside the game frame, thereby demonstrating the puzzle-likeness if it all, while more than hinting at the possibility of the perfect game and the observation that you're playing in a game frame.Lovely, the whole thing. Easy to learn. Short games (maybe 10 minutes). Fun for a remarkably wide range of players. There's the dexterity and luck part, so it's not necessarily the smartest who always wins. Which inevitably makes for more fun. Unless you get too serious about the game. On the other hand, it's good to know you can get serious about it if you have to - just in case. [SEP]","[CLS] Batik Classic is an original game challenging players to enhance and improve their visual and planning skills. Players take turns dropping irregular shapes between two panes of the plexiglass play area. A steady hand, good eye and strategic planning are needed as the pieces are prone to slipping into unexpected places. When a dropped piece sticks out of the top, that player is OUT! Includes 18 wood game pieces, game board and instructions. Recommended for ages 6 years and up and intended for 2 players. This is a multilingual game.

It falls apart if you so much as bump it and she enjoys moving toys from room to room. I used Superglue to hold it together, which worked reasonably well. The roof doesn't stay on at all. Since she needs to remove it for play, that's a problem, since without the roof, the structure is very weak (Superglue & all).It's about what you'd expect for the money. I would recommend searching for a one-piece set with no assembly or a sturdier one, maybe made of wood.I know Breyer is a classic name so I took a chance that the toy would be a better quality than it is. My daughter plays with the horses and the fence but I think after a year of My stable broke again! it's time to take my own advice and find something better.ETA: We eventually resorted to super-gluing it together... and it still fell apart (within months). It went into the garbage. There are much better options out there. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My daughter, who is 3, got this as a Christmas present, and likes it very much.  She is gentle with toys and used to playing with small objects; so far, nothing has been broken.  I found it fairly easy to assemble, BUT it is not very secure if you just snap the pieces into the plastic; at first, it kept snapping undone.  The plastic is a bit flimsy.  I recommend using gorilla glue (or some other type of superglue) to make sure that the stable is really stable.  The other major defect for us is that it is quite difficult to get the horses to stand upright.  They wobble or fall down, even though they are not (yet) broken.  Other small horses (such as Playmobil horses, on which playmobil people can ride) are more satisfactory at least for younger children, because they stand up well, and you can put a rider on.  But we like this barn/stable, because it can be used with a number of other small animals, including playmobile.  Also like that it comes with a jump and some fencing -- good for playing zoo as well as stable.  So: not ideal, but still a very nice, enjoyable toy.

B00004R8LW,"[CLS] Pieces are large and well made. We have had the puzzle for over about 2 years now. It was one of the first my little boy could do by himself at about age 3-4. This is due to the large pieces and the fact it only has 24. Two years later he still likes to put it together those days he is into puzzles. Nice puzzle for the price. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My two sons, 35 months and 30 months, received this puzzle for Christmas, and in the two weeks since, have played with it multiple times per day.  My 35 month-old can already put it together himself, but that has not subtracted from the fun!  He loves to figure out which pieces go where.  Once the puzzle is complete, both boys love to look at the finished picture and point out all the construction vehicles, and the different colors.  Then they revel in pulling it apart, to start over immediately.  The puzzle is a good, large size when completed, and if it weren't for my younger son's extremely enthusiastic puzzle-disassembling ability, I would have given this puzzle 5 stars.  However, one of the corners has already bent up a bit, making the adjoining piece not stay together well.  In fact, now that I think about it, I wish the pieces stuck together a little better.  As little ones put the puzzle together, they are constantly climbing all over it, and pieces they have already assembled are inclined to come apart.  This is a minor complaint, though.  I also wish the storage box for the puzzle were a bit sturdier.  We have already had to tape three of the corners back together, both on the top and bottom of the box!  Again, minor complaint.  I definitely would still recommend the puzzle, and I would buy it again.  It's amazing that it can hold the attention of an almost 3 year-old for at least 30 consecutive minutes!  (I was unable to change my durability rating...meant to give it 4 stars.)Three months later, I have had to glue and tape several of the connecting parts of the puzzles back together after they were bent up, unintentionally, by my two sons.  Therefore, I stand by my original durability rating.  This puzzle is not as durable as the other two floor puzzles they have.  I think it is because the pieces are larger, but not thicker.  My kids rarely play with this puzzle now, because it is so difficult to get all the pieces together now that some have been glued several times. But also because my son who turned 3 six weeks ago received the other two puzzles for his birthday, so there is a novelty factor. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I gave this puzzle to my best friend's almost 4-year old son and he LOVED IT.  The pieces are big, the color is good, and he liked seeing the individual items as they appeared when he put the pieces in place.  Highly recommend.

So we bought him this one, and I don't know who looked more stunned when he opened it -- him or me. It is really huge, so be advised that it's 2 ft by 3 ft, and plan accordingly. I wouldn't recommend it for those who are short on floor space, because it's not the kind of puzzle you can do on a table.Once my son got over his shock, he seemed to have fun with the puzzle. But it's hard for him to reach across the expanse of the puzzle with his little arms; he ends up having to get up and walk around the puzzle to put some of the giant pieces in place. He's just at the right age to start doing 24-piece puzzles, but maybe he's just too little for something that's scaled so big.

However, we have owned the game for a year now and it still gets played fairly regularly, which definitely makes it a four-star game in my opinion!

The game board is maybe 12x9 inches and, to make matters worse, comes in (2) pieces that fit together like a puzzle.  I thought it was a mistake when I opened the box.  What was Ravensbuger thinking on this one?

Thomas supports are really kind of bad.  They are expensive and don't even hold the track up well and my boys end up being frustrated when the hills fall over!So, I searched high and low for better track supports and spent more money on different versions than I care to admit.Then I came across these and saw the great reviews and decided to try them out.

I can finally make interesting multi-level hills for my boys without them falling over or gluing the tracks down.  Really awesome stuff! (Well, as far as wooden trains go anyway).The only downside for me is that these do get kind of pricey.  At 2 per pack, I needed 4 packs to do what I really wanted to do, which is have one curve on a train table with a 1 then 2 level hill.  So, that's $44.  I mean, I guess many thomas buildings cost that and I've paid it, but it's just kind of amazing how much these wooden track sets costs.Anyway, I'm very happy with these and my boys now finally have some cool hills that don't just fall over at the slightest breeze.

This game is simple, but that doesn't mean it's not challenging or fun.It's a good child/adult game, and I'd highly recommend this over some of the gimmikicy games out there.  It can be played over and over with a lot of different variations on the outcome, and while a good player can win consistantly, like many decent games that don't rely on chance, this game can be played to ties or near ties if both people understand it.  I think that makes it a better game.It's good for strengthening logical thinking. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is my favorite game.  The rules are easy enough so that you can learn in 5 minutes.  However, the game changes as your skill level changes.If you are young, this is an excellent mind-expanding game, plus a lot of fun.If you aren't very good at games, this can be a good social game that is quick to learn.  Just make sure you play someone at your skill level.If you love strategy games, this game is for you.  If you haven't played it since you were a kid, you probably haven't appreciated the intense strategic elements in this game.  I think this game coined the phrase A minute to learn, a lifetime to master.  It is a lot of fun going through the mastery process.The quality is not as good as I remember it as a kid, but the board will hold together even though the green felt will wear quickly.And, as a trivia note, Othello is the brand name of the generic game of Reversi.  Reversi is available for free at many online gaming sites. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I love this game.  And the children (ages 8-11) love it too.

I have to save some face in our house.This newer version is lightweight and holds all the game pieces in two trays. The game comes with a couple of extras though in case you lose one.If you've never played Othello, their tagline, A minute to learn, a lifetime to master is true to form. It takes a moment to understand the game but winning, especially against a very smart 12 year old, gets tougher and tougher. This is a two person only game.Each player picks a color (black or white). The game starts with two white and two black pieces on the board. The first player places a piece of their color down so that there is at least one of their opponents colors in between. Any piece that is now connected by your two colors, gets flipped over to your color. It is hard to explain but easy once the board is in front of you and the directions are clear as well, clearer than my description!So the object is to have the majority of game pieces in your color by the end of the game. There are tons of strategies, like being the first to get to an outside edge or a corner - the best way to get one up in the game.It takes about 5-10 minutes to play a game and it sets up easily, goes away easily. You can create variations for younger, inexperienced players so that they have a fighting chance.A great game for kids, adults, or a group setting. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Othello is one those rare and unique games like Chess, Checkers, and Go that require nothing but strategy to win. There really is no luck involved whatsoever, and the rules are quite simple: use your pieces to surround that of your opponent's so you can flip their pieces over, revealing your color which is on the bottom side of their pieces. At the end of the game, the player who has the most pieces showing his/her color is the winner. The rules are real simple, and yet it can be such a difficult game to win.I was introduced to this game when I was a kid and have loved it ever since. There is so much strategy involved with every move you make, and you also need to pay close attention to where your opponent is playing his/her pieces. One bad decision can turn into disaster, especially late in the game. It's not unusual to feel nervous when playing a close game, because your strategy can change so much that you may wonder if you're making the right decisions, and you might be hoping your opponent either plays or doesn't play in a certain spot. There are no dice or cards or any other luck factors involved in determining the winner. It all comes down to brains: who can play in the right spots at the right time in order to score the most points and also keep those points by the time the board is completely filled.You can make a strong case for Chess as being the best strategy game of all time, but Othello ranks right up there beside it. The rules for Othello however are much more simple and straightforward, but like chess, it can be so difficult to win. There's an old slogan for Othello which is, A minute to learn, a lifetime to master, and that's a very accurate description for this game. You can play a game where everything seems to work in your favor and win it easily with a lopsided score like 50-14, feeling like you're the best Othello player in the world; then you'll play another game and get thumped with a score like 17-47 and feel like you couldn't do anything right if your life depended on it. That's how much the strategy of this game can change. It has to keep evolving so you can try staying a step ahead of your opponent. It's such a great and rewarding feeling when you outsmart your opponent to win the game, especially if it's a close score like 33-31, but when you lose, you can't help but think back to some of the questionable moves you made earlier in the game. Simply put, Othello is a very fun and classic strategy game that requires all the power of your brain in order to win.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] First, let me say this game is fun if you are playing on a quality game board with quality playing pieces.Othello is a great game for young children. The rules are easy to learn and this game provides a solid education in basic strategy.However, I set aside my own nostalgia for this game and looked at the reality of what's inside the box.Here's the negatives:This game board is cheap.The poor construction means poor durability; the faux felt is already peeling away from the board.The board is designed so tight that the game pieces almost have to be snapped into place when you flip them.The game pieces are thinner and harder to pick up, especially for older hands (beware grandparents).Steer clear of this version from Mattel. See if you can find a better quality version of the game. It makes a difference.Message to Mattel: I'd rather pay the extra $10-$15 for you to provide better-quality materials.

They did not make good tones unless banged on a very specific type of surface on a very specific spot.

B00004TZY6,"[CLS] Simple doll. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I have a small doll collection mainly consisting of International Barbie dolls (dressed in various costumes from the country they represent) and several much more expensive collectible dolls. I have friends who collect Madame Alexander dolls so I thought since most of my more expensive dolls were baby dolls I'd see what the fuss was about.To be honest I really don't understand why these are collectible dolls. This is an okay doll. The eyes blink in harmony, the doll is evenly stuffed and she (I am assuming it is a female doll as it is dressed in pink) is packed nicely.  That said I think you could probably spend a third of the price to get a comparable doll at the big box store that specializes in children. The sewing along the seams was okay, but not great. The outfit opens in front and would look better with a back opening. The tag on the doll says Love is in the Detail. and most of those details seemed to be in the outfit and not the doll. The outfit is very nicely sewn with lace detailing and ribbons on the feet.I'd never really examined a Madame Alexander doll in detail as my friends who collect them keep them boxed away. My collectibles are generally on display since I don't see the use in having something you can't enjoy visually instead of knowing it is boxed and locked!  Anyhow, this is a nice doll and probably would do well in a collector's display or closet, but I'm going to unbox mine and give it to my granddaughters to play with when they come over. It will fit nicely in the dollhouse that is over here. I know this is heresy for those of you who collect them, but since this is probably going to be my first and last doll from her line, I'd like to know that she will be well played with and loved. [SEP]"",""[CLS] When I was a little girl, my mother used to buy me one Madame Alexander doll every Christmas.  As I grew older, the dolls disappeared, perhaps my mother gave them away.  Perhaps I lost one in a move.  I forget.  Regardless, I spent the past few years trying to replace each of the dolls from my collection and, although it wasn't easy, it was a joy to finally have the final doll added to my home.This year, I wanted to give my granddaughter her very first Madame Alexander doll.  I chose this doll as her first, hoping it would be much loved, would be worn out with cuddles.  The doll arrived today and, the first thing I did when I opened the box, was to smell the new doll, to see if the doll still smelled the way I remember.  It didnt.  But everything else was familiar.  The face and the eyes opening and closing.  Its a nice size for a little girls arms. And if my granddaughter decides she doesnt want to cuddle the doll, she can begin a collection of her own.This is the perfect first choice doll for my darling girl and Im hoping it won't be her last Madame Alexander doll. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Im not sure what I expected. After ordering this item through Amazon Vine, I studied the product page and thought I was getting a nice, collectible baby doll. This doll does not match the price. It is a stuffed doll with a plastic head nothing more. The doll actually measures 10 inches, not 12 inches as stated. It comes in a very cheesy thin box.In this economy, we are all looking for good value for our dollar. I thought since the retail price was about $45 that this would be a quality doll my grand children could play with when they come to visit. But this doll is stuffing, and plastic--at almost $50 that is about $40 too much.If you are looking for something nice for your kids or grand kids, I would look at another product. I did a search for baby dolls for toddlers and young children and Amazon has countless options, at $25 and under. In my opinion, this doll is not worth the retail price. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I've had a few Madame Alexander dolls and this one is no exception to the quality that Madame Alexander is known for. This doll though although it looks big on screen is very small. It's only 12 tall but is the perfect size for a toddler. There are no small parts and it is very soft. It comes in a very nice box that is ready for gifting, wrapped in pink tissue paper. She is hairless which is fine with me, especially since my toddler loves pulling her doll's hair out. I would certainly recommend this for little girls.

It is absolutely unreal that we are doing this in our house.  And really freaky too.  These teeny, tiny caterpillars arrived in two cups, and they have seriously grown like 50 times their original size.  They just started cocoon-ing today.  One BIG TIP: don't order the caterpillars unless you have warm weather because 2-3 weeks after you receive the caterpillars, you have butterflies on your hands.  And they need to be released!

We received two jars with 5 caterpillars in each - all were alive.You need to know that there is a $5 shipping charge on top of buying this product. I supposed you could use the pavilion with your own caterpillars too so that there wasn't the extra expense but really, some of the cost of buying this is having access to getting the painted lady caterpillars.I'll update the review once the caterpillars go through metamorphosis and we can see who the pavilion works. Although, I've seen it on display at one of our local stores and it's really neat to see them inside. [SEP]"",""[CLS] They were selling this same thing at a local fair for like $40...  Amazon, as usual, had a great deal at around $20.  We ordered/registered for our Larve online.  They shipped us 2 little tubs of 5 caterpillars each= 10 total.  I believe shipping was an additional $5.  At $20 for a big basket, I thought and additional $5 shipping would be a little crummy if I gave it as a gift, only because I wouldn't have known about shipping unless I openned it up with the kid. (minus 1 star for shipping).  We got out 10 painted lady caterpillars.  2 fell off the paper lid and fell into the muck.  Good thing I saw them.  So we followed the directions, hung the paper disks with 4 caterpillars each on the mesh wall, and laid the other 2 that fell off on a tissue.  Over the last few days, we've hatched 10 butterflies.  They are happilly sampling watermellon.  We are planning to release them once the rain we've been getting stops.Pro:  Even as an adult, it was very neat to see the whole process happen.  I half wish I setup a video camera.  I kept missing the things hatching.  and I felt like when I turned around, they'd gone from Caterpilars to Crysili.  So keep an eye on them!Cons:  Shipping additional (charge me the extra couple bucks shipping up front)The cups the caterpilars came in were very difficult to open.  I'm no weakling, and I was sure I was going to knock a crysilis off the paper trying to open them.  Beware the delicate paper liner beneath the cap that the crysilis is attached to.  I'm sure there's some shipping reason or something they're on there so tight, I would expect more than one caterpillar has hit the floor trying to open these things.

The teapot is cute and makes a twinkling noise when you pour or plays the song I'm a little teapot when you press the button on top.  It also comes with a milk jug and sugar bowl.  All the things you need for a wonderful afternoon tea.  Everything fits neatly on the tray and my daughter doesn't seem to have too much trouble carrying it around when serving tea to me and her special doll.  This is a wonderful tea set for play, not too many pieces and made by Fisher Price so you know it's going to last. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this for my daughter when she was 20 months old. It was an immediate delight. It is colorful and the sounds are cute. She likes 'making tea' for Mommy, Daddy, friends and for her dolls.

We have never had anything in the cups, but the tea pot and cups are big enough to actually have water in them to play with when she gets older.  She just absolutely loves to pour the tea and stir and drink from the cup, its very cute.The only thing that I have noticed:  When you tip the tea pot, it makes a little sound that you tip it.  This little sound is there even when you play the I'm a little teapot song - so the song and the sound overlap each other.. so that is a little annoying, but still an absolutely wonderful toy for any little girl! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Very well made and cute.  Each cup, saucer and spoon set have their own color, flower, butterfly or heart motif.

The music somes from inside the teapot lid when it is tipped. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We got this for our 1 1/2 year old for Christmas and she loves it. We all play tea party all of the time. The colors are great and the cups, tea pot, plates and bowls are a great size; easy for little hands to use. It is really cute when you push the button on top of the tea pot because it plays the song I'm a little tea pot. My only complaint is when the lid is tipped over it makes noice until you lay it flat, it can get really annoying if it gets tipped over accidentally, but other than that we love it!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My daughter was 18 months old when she got this for a gift. It has been a favorite of hers ever since and she's two and a half now.This is just perfect for little fingers (and mom's fingers too)! The teapot holds enough water to fill four cups and the four cups are big enough to hold more than a drop of 'tea'. Yet they are small enough that a spill does not equal a disaster.Everything fits onto a sturdy tray and my daughter seems to have no difficulty carrying the tray with everything on it. There is a cute creamer and sugar bowl and spoons that are just perfect for using.The teapot plays I'm a little teapot when the button on top is pushed and makes cute tinkly sounds when the teapot is tipped to pour. It is a pleasant sound and not so loud that it annoys.If you are like I am and look for gifts that encourage creative, imaginative play this teapot is perfect. If you look for toys that do more than blink or play music at a push of a button, this toy fits the bill. It is fairly quiet and easy to play with and fun.Enjoy.

This loader can load just about any large dump truck! With the exception of the Mack granite dump truck. Now here's why I say that, The bucket on this loader is so large that if you taken a full bucket part of the load will go over the side of the truck. . The only thing that I really do not like about the loader is that there is hardly any operator space inside the cab. But that can be remedied because you can just use a smaller person like a G.I. Joe or play Mobile guy.

B00005BMX9,"[CLS] My eighteen month old son simply loves this airport playset from Fisher-Price.  Part of their Little People line, it comes with plenty of big, chunky pieces that are easy for my son to play with.  He enjoys playing with the helicopter the most, but also likes the airplane and taxi cab that are included with this set.The set is easily assembled, and can quickly be taken apart for storage.  The biggest chore with this set is applying all of the stickers, but it's no big task to do this.  There are a few loose pieces that can be easily lost.  In fact, my son has already lost the two pieces of luggage included with the set.  A parasol and windsock are attached to the playset, but they do come off rather easily.Other than those minor problems, this is a fun set for youngsters.  It does not light up or make any sounds, so your child will have to use their imagination to come up with plane, helicopter and car noises.  I personally see that as a good thing because it makes my child a bigger part of the actual playset.Three Little People are included.  They are two pilots and one very obvious passenger (with a cheesy shirt to boot!).  The set also features a runway and a road for the taxi to go on.Overall, this is a very fun set and I highly recommend it to any family who has a little one that is interested in airplanes or helicopters or just likes to have fun. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I have the discovery version of this and found it strange that they changed it until I remembered a few things about my 2 year old's toy. First off, let me say the airport can be fun without the sounds and lights, which can be turned off on the one we have, basically turning it into this new model. (My son doesn't always turn it on to play with it). This newer one looks exactly like the older version minus one baggage car and no real landing lights on the runway.When we got it, we thought is was so cute and amazing at how the cars, plane, and helicopter would make noise just by rolling near it. but as time went on, I sometimes found the sounds annoying and it would malfunction occasionaly. It has an on/off switch on the bottom, but if you leave it in the on position, it can be turned on with the X landing  mark on top of the control tower (for kids to do it). And then over a few minutes will go into a sleep mode. Ok, that was great, but after awhile it wouldn't turn on and i'd have to flip it over and manually turn it on and off and on again to get it to work. This actually started just months after getting it. And now the vehicles don't always make the sounds when rolled over the landing strip and road. My son gets very frustrated sometimes. So I can only guess that they were having some  problems and complaints about the discovery sounds version. Hope this helps anyone out there who's disappointed that they can't find the first one. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My son got this airport as a gift at 20 months and 6 weeks later, it is still his favorite toy.  We have several F-P little people playsets and like to use them with this airport.Unlike some other reviewers here, we are VERY glad that it did not come with any battery-hungry and annoying lights and sounds to irritate mommy & daddy's nerves.  It's getting harder and harder to find toys these days where the only noise comes from the children themselves.The playset was easy to assemble and comes apart for storage.  The only negatives I've seen are that the windsock and umbrella are easily removed (and lost), but all in all, this set gives our son quite a bit of self-play and helps him develop his imagination.  Where else but here can you see a Fisher-Price sheep pilot a passenger jet? [SEP]"",""[CLS] It appears in reading other reviews and looking at the pictures that Fisher Price has changed its' airport drastically.  We have the set that has sounds and lights and also has another car with an attachment.  I must confess, I find the sounds and lights to be the best part, as does my son.  He loves making the airplane take-off, the helicopter whirl, the taxi and the car rev, the luggage carasel sing, and the barricade tell him to stop, please pay the toll, or go.  It is a great toy, but is definitely worth looking for the sounds and lights version.

It has always been a hit when our kids were younger. Smart Mouth is the next step up, although the game play is very different.Smart Mouth is a great way for kids to keep exercising their brains (and adults too!) by having to think of words that begin with the letter on the left and end with the letter on the right. It's not as easy as you would think and there are times that we find ourselves looking around thinking, 'I should really know this...' and feeling at a complete loss for words (pun intended!).I have really enjoyed playing it with my 8 year old lately and have been pleasantly surprised at some of the words she comes up with. I especially like that she wants to keep playing it!There are variations to make it easier or harder so it is not just for younger children. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Smart mouth is fun for kids as soon as they can spell a collection of words.  The rules can be adapted to make it fun for everyone at the same time: Little sis might need words of 3 or more letters, and proper nouns are OK; big sis needs 4+ letter, no names but places are ok, and parents have to think of 5+ letter words, and no proper nouns or plurals at all.  Make your own adjustments, and then have FUN!For quite a while, we carried Smart Mouth in the car for those boring times when we're stuck waiting... at the doctor's office, at a restaurant, etc.  We would pull out Smart Mouth and play, just for fun, not even bothering to keep score.  You'll be surprised how quickly kids learn to spell, too, since they need to know when a word ends in a silent e, or starts with a silent k, etc.Our daughter's speech therapist recommended pen-and-paper exercises for her expressive speech delay, and Smart Mouth makes them into a game!  The therapist was impressed with her progress, and all we did special was to play Smart Mouth.Smart Mouth, great fun, combined with stealth learning! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this game on a hunch that it might click with my gaming group. My hunch was right. This is very popular with my gaming group who are quite the wordsmiths. The rules are simple, come up with a common word of five or more letters when the two letters are revealed. First one to shout it out gets the letters. If no one gets it, move on to the next set and the one who calls out an acceptable word then gets all four letters. In our group, you must wait for both letters to be announced before you can answer. The one with the most letters when the device runs out is the winner.There are no Qs, Xs or Zs, but all the other letters are there. Some letter combinations provide a challenge, like E and O. We almost moved on to the next set before I called out embryo. The only bad thing is in this game, soft spoken people may be drowned out by louder voices when answering. Other than that, a great game where if you snooze, you lose. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My whole family enjoys this simple vocabulary game.  The set up is very similar to Zingo, except instead of the handle sliding forward and releasing two bingo chips, it releases two letters.Players need to think of a word that begins with the first letter and ends with the second.  We require 4 letters from our kids, and 5 or more adults.  You can bend the rules even more for an early reader and allow them to call out 3 letter words.  The first person to shout out their word takes the letters, and at the end of the game, the player with the most chips wins.You may think that the adults always win, but that is not the case!  My youngest has a photographic memory and he gives us all a run for our money.  And adults can sometimes just blank on a word while the kids have one on the tip of their tongue.  The result is that everyone plays feeling like they have a decent shot at winning.My husband likes this game because it is pretty quick, we can play a round in less than 10 minutes.  My youngest really likes sorting the chips and putting them in the handle, and sliding it forward to release the letters.  The middle kids like the challenge of trying to come up with words first, and I like the fact the whole family plays it together! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Word games are typically fun but don't play with someone who will just dominate the game.  We had somewhat of a good time with this one but we rate games by how easily we are distracted by things other than the game.  The premise of the game is to quickly make a word from the two dispensed tiles that begins with one of the letters and ends with the other, e.g. D and L are dispensed you could say drill.  Deal would not work because the word has to be at least 5 letters.  I'll tell you one thing, you never realize just how many four letter words there are until you play this game and you are guessing but you can't score.It is a thinking game, and unless you are an English buff or just love words, it is a game that can have you stumped quite often. [SEP]","[CLS] The only game you won't get your mouth washed out with soap for having a Smart Mouth! Go head to head with family and friends in this quick-thinking, shout it out word game.

Get a cheap screened pole cleaner to scoop out any leaves, etc. and I just poured a little bleach in it when it got a little green or cloudy and that usually cleaned it up, or just bend the side over, let the water out and fill it again if need be. It doesn't hold that much water actually.  Usually you can get by with about a months use before you have to replace the water entirely.

B00005O6VG,"[CLS] Easy to set up, however DO make sure your ground is level. No matter how level you think it is to begin with.  Buy or borrow a nice long level - a construction/building level works good - and even out your ground surface first with a nice layer of sand.  If your pool is 10' round, that means you will need AT LEAST enough to cover 100'Square.  Multiply that by a couple of inches.  Now recheck with your level until you have a good flat, level foundation to put it on.  Cover with a tarp or pool ground cover bigger than the pool diameter.  We purchased a bigger pump, the one included is for 530 gallons per hour, and the pool is 1080 gallons, so you do the math.  I would also highly recommend a nice pool skimmer and a salt system.

Took probably 5 hours total to set up and fill.The surprising thing was how difficult it was to find pool chemicals up here in NYC. Having lived in Florida where pool chemicals are sold in every store, it was a shock. We went to two Home Depots, one Lowe's, and a few hardward supply stores before finding some. Then I found this site Pool Solutions.  They'll show you how to maintain your Kiddie Pool (which this qualifies as) using household bleach, baking soda, and Borax. Great calculator based on the size of your pool.  You'll still need to purchase a test kit, however.  Be warned that your pool is much smaller than the typical pools that the chemicals are made for.  So even thoough we used 1/4 of a shock packet, it was still way too much for our pool.  We ended up emptying half the water and adding fresh water so we could swim in it without waiting a few days for the sun to get the chlorine out naturally.  Sigh.Note: The bigger pool kits contain a ground cover, cover, and sometimes a skimmer.  THIS DOES NOT.  We ended up buying 4 heavy duty vinyl shower curtains to act as a liner and a solar cover.If you have younger kids who can't swim, be really careful.  Consider purchasing a pool alarm.  Yes, it will cost you more than the pool... but $150 or so is worth it when you think of the consequences.  Even being with my son in the pool (both my husband and I were there), I was shocked at how quickly he could fall or jump and find himself underwater.  Scared me to death. So, we purchased a Powr Swimmer Swim Trainer, which is wonderful.  We also purchased a solar cover from Aqua Leisure which is nice... no idea if it really helps the temperature, though.  Probably a real pool cover from a pool dealer would do a better job... this is just blue plastic, basically. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We bought this pool last summer thinking it would be a great way to cool off here in the hot California desert.  And it would have been...  but...This pool is JUST deep enough that it never seemed to really warm up.  Which is no big deal for older kids or adults but I had this dilusion that I could go in and put my baby in a float and he could float around and and I could cool off.  But he HATED it.  So unless I went in while he was napping or I put him in his playpen while I swam, which he also hated, it just didn't work out.So consider that, if you have little ones.  It's refreshing in the heat but may be too cold for wee ones.Then, as the summer went on, the pool became one heck of a science experiment.  I guess my husband and I knew having a pool was a lot of work but we didn't really KNOW...  kind of like having a baby, ha ha.  As time passed the water turned a spectacular shade of green.  Slime on the walls.  Green gunk in the filter.  It took a lot of fiddling and trips to the pool supply store and water testing and $$$ for chemicals to get the pool back in working (well, swimming) order.So, just know that.  You can't set up the pool and turn your back on it.I will say the set up was easy - we just stuck it on out back patio, which is concerete.  Of course the concrete had cracks in it and as the summer passed (and summer is LONG here) the patio kind of sunk towards the back, and the pool went kind of crooked...  but it held up fine.  Never got a leak in the pool or the inflated ring.When we got the pool out of storage this year the rubber rings on the filter had rotted but they can be purchased from Intex for pretty cheap.  (...)ANYWAY this pool has great potential, but if you have little kids or are lazy, or both (like us), you might want to reconsider.This year we have decided instead to set up the 22X90 inch round pool Intex makes...  it has a bench in it which I don't like but you don't have to insert it.  So far we are loving it.  It is big enough for an adult to cool off in, but shallow enough (I only filled it to 1/2 - 2/3 capacity) that it warms up to a pleasant temperature so my 20 month old likes it.  It's also small enough that if it turns into a science lab again , it will be no great loss to dump it and start from the beginning.I suggest THIS route for people like us.  Everyone else will do just fine with the bigger pools.  You can't go wrong if you're honest about your needs and abilities here.  :-)  I think these are pretty good quality products that take swimming pools from being something only rich people have in their backyards to being workable options for the rest of us.  Especially those of us who seem to move every few years. [SEP]","[CLS] This Easy Set pool is the perfect alternative to steel-walled pools. It is ready for water in 10 minutes, and no sand is required to support the walls. Measuring 10 feet in diameter and 30 inches tall, the pool includes a filter pump and a video.

Green Velveteen  Robe with shoulder closure and lighter green gown with lovely patterned piece in the middle.  You won't be disappointed in her.  I will save her for next St. Patrick's day and look for a companion piece so each of my granddaughters will have a bit of the old country.And I'll be looking for books on Amazon's second hand offers about Irish folklore.

She is built thin and with creamy white skin.  Her make-up is very formal yet gorgeous, and her face has a sort of peacefulness to it.  But her hair is definately one of the best parts about her!  It is red and wavy with a small braid going down the front.  It is also very long and is not easily matted.  Her dress is decorative with a plastic gold-colored belt.  A snap did break in the back where the dress buttons up, but it's hardly noticable.  Over top of her dress she wears a forest green satin cape with a broach titled The Tara Broach that matches her belt.  The crown is also nice, but I prefer her without it.Overall, she is a lovely Barbie who is easily one of my favorites.  She is meant to be collectible, but she isn't too accessorized or non-durable to be played with, which is how I use her.  I think she is worthy of a high recommendation.

Her complexion is fair, and her auburn hair shines with deep, rich color; a section on the left is braided, and cascades to her thigh.  Her cheeks are dusty roses, her green eyes seem to twinkle, and her lips are the color of garnets.  She wears a forest green velvet cloak; the clasp is a Tara Broach, a very famous bejeweled pin thought to have been worn by Celtic royalty.  The golden broach is the color of her crown and the three Celtic medallions on the half-belt at her waist.  Her dress is loose fitting, as the time would indicate.  Down the middle of the front of her gown is a 1 wide gold, green, and shades of rose trim that displays several Celtic designs.Behind the Princess of Ireland, there is a castle with several turrets.  Should you choose to display this doll out of her box, a stand is included.Fun:  She is stunning, and brings imagination the first time you glance at her.Educational benefit: This is an opportunity to share the history of the Celts and the beauty of Ireland.Durability:  Well constructed; if a young child plays with this fair lass, then expect her hair to get tangled, but she will hold together.This is a very reasonably priced doll for collectors and as gifts for favorite children, they will love her -- another princess for their collections.Victoria Tarrani [SEP]","[CLS] Princess of Ireland is a special Barbie that has been crafted with style and loving attention to detail.

My son excitedly picked this out and I thought it would be PERFECT for him to keep all his supplies together and he would be able to carry it out to use any time.

B00005YXV2,"[CLS] I am reviewing this from more of an adult perspective, since I bought it for my mom.  Since she loves the chicken dance and animal toys that do strange things, it was a perfect gift.  This Elmo is a completely adorable idea, if somewhat bizarre.  Lots of fun.  Hours of entertainment.  I can see how younger children might break this toy, as Elmo is full of mechanical parts, and not too soft and cuddly.  But for slightly odd grownups, it's perfect. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Along with Hokey Pokey Elmo, Chicken Dance Elmo sits sadly unused on my son's toy shelf.  He was fun for a time.  I heard the chicken dance more times than I could count at the beginning.  After a month or two, the novelty wore off.  My suggestion, if you can get this on sale, go for it.  It is not worth full price. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 13 month old son loves Elmo so much so I though I would get him this, we did the demo on the fisher-price website and he loved it so I went out tonight and got it for him. It sounded really loud in the store but I thought it would be for demo purposes only (usually u take out the tab and it takes the toys out of demo mode) well it wasn't. This toy is so cute and fun but way way too loud. I don't think it is really annoying or anything because its so cute the way Elmo sings the chicken dance (I walk around the house all day singing it) but it is so loud. I am afraid my son is like gonna go deaf and there is no way to get to the speakers to cover them with tape or anything to make it lower. Well I would definately recommend this toy but just be aware of the loudness. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I try to avoid toys that just have a push of a button to make noise. I try to avoid toys that don't have an off button or a volume control.I look for toys that encourage creativity, exploration, and fun. I look for toys that are not too loud and have more than a button to push.However, having said all that, this toy is a ton of fun.Elmo sings a great chicken dance and it's not just little snippets of the song, it's the whole song. My kids (age 4 and 2) enjoy dancing to this song and copying Elmo. Elmo bounces up and down and flaps his 'wings'. It's cute and I haven't gotten tired of it yet, despite buying this many months ago.I can't say that this is very educational. However, not every toys needs to be educational.Enjoy. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I never planned on boarding the Elmo Craze Express but this is one Elmo toy that my 11-month old son LOVES!  It's almost inexplicable...he just loves the silly singing and dancing.  He even bobs along with it.  On the con side, I'd have to say that it's not very educational.  And as for durability, it tips easily. My son loves to grab Elmo's googly eyes but pushing down on Elmo while he's dancing produces an awful clicking noise.  But if you want to see a huge goofy grin on your child's face, then this toy is for you! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My toddler (22 months) received this from her new baby brother.

Once you take it out of the packaging and pull the plastic thingo out the actual song and dance moves goes for a lot longer and it's loud!  It absolutely drives us bananas but my toddler just loves it.She loves to watch it and laughs hysterically and she tries to copy the dance moves.  She drags it around the house, the car and outside and it is surviving.  She hangs onto the wings as it's dancing and it doesn't break ...

B000062SRP,"[CLS] Replaced our old one with a new one. A homeschoool fav for the first 3 kids. Our first Math Mat lasted about 10 years... got a new one for the younger kids now! This one seems verrrry durable. We have had great luck with these lasting a long time. Our two year old even likes it. Younger kids can do numbers, older kids the other games. Perfect for all ages. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My daughter Loves this Math Mat! I paid $23.00 with shipping for it on Ebay, and it was worth every penny. After playing it just one time, my daughter has gotten faster at math. It is extremely durable and I like that it has different skill levels.I have two complaints however:1. Even though I have her stand on the outside of the mat and run around to the numbers, she still somehow hits the reset button all the time-as mentioned by other reviewers.2. There is no way-that I have found-to do untimed math problems, so my daughter was getting frustrated at first that she couldn't get the answers in time. (She is only 4 and is just getting the hang of addition.)Other than that, I Love that they have made a game that kids can get up and move around and learn math! Much better than sitting around using counting bears or working on endless work sheets! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 3 year old is obsessed with numbers. Even though I know that he is probably just memorizing at this point, he is constantly asking to do addition and do subtraction with me. He still has some difficulty listening to instructions, so he often doesn't do the games beyond simple counting correct because he just gets so excited by this toy. If you have a child who is interested in numbers, this is for you! [SEP]"",""[CLS] The mat does what it says it does, but when you actually get it and experience the simplicity of it, it doesn't really engage you.  At least it didn't engage my Kindergartener (5 1/2 yr old), or my 1st grader both of whom got bored easily.  I bought it because my kindergartner is starting addition this semester, and I thought it would be a fun way to learn, but the mat does nothing to make learning fun (e.g. no fun noises, no games that make you arrive at the correct answer, etc).  You accomplish the same by taking a piece of paper and writting down simple additions and subtractions, or taking a mic and asking your child what 2+ 2 is.In terms of the quality of the mat itself, it looks good and durable, and so far it works fine.I will update this review later in the semester if my boy's interest changes at all, as he starts learning addition in school.  For now though, for the cost of this ($39) I do not think it is worth it (the teaching cash register also from LR and $39, is on the other hand worth the money). [SEP]"",""[CLS] The Math Mat is kinda cool and my children (3.5 and 5.5 years of age) and I have been having fun playing with it since we got it for Christmas.My daughter uses it to practice addition.  The Math Mat gives her an equation, such as `what is 2 + 8' on the Easy Level and she runs around and jumps on the usually correct number.  If you don't get the number correct, the Mat tells you what the answer is.  And key to the Math Mat's success and popularity is that it always keeps a positive outlook.My 3.5 year old son on the other hand can't do equations so he plays at identifying the numbers.  The Easy Level on the Mat is just that: identify the numbers from 0 to 10.  The more Difficult Level gives children a sequence of numbers for which they must give the missing number.  For example, the Mat will say something like, `What number comes next.  Then it will say the sequence 3, 4, _ and your child has to come up with 5 for an answer.I foresee a slight lag problem where the Mat might not get much use.  A Toddler might have fun identifying their numbers, and a Preschooler might have fun filling in the sequence, but there will probably be a gap in time before they progress to an age where they can do simple addition equations.  (Then again, if they have the Math Mat maybe there won't be a gap.)Four Stars.  Good educational fun.  Toddlers and Preschoolers will probably need parental help and motivation.The Math Mat takes 3 AA batteries.  To play you put the mat on the floor and then choose whether you want to do addition or subtraction or number identification.  It is all pretty intuitive and we haven't had to look at instructions. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a great toy. My very active five year old loves this game. He can play and move and review his numbers and adding and subtracting.Two comments about this math mat though-1. The numbers face outwards and the child stands in the middle of the numbers. When my son first started playing on this it took him some time to figure out which numbers were which. The numbers need to face the child.2. The restart button is on the inside of the circle where the child stands and is easily stepped on. This leads to frustration sometimes if the child is not careful because they step on this restart button and the game starts over.Otherwise, this is an excellent way to review number recognition, adding and subtracting.Enjoy.

B000063XO3,"[CLS] This was a favorite game for my two kids. I'm sorry to hear that it might no longer be manufactured? Even though my kids have outgrown it, they still want to keep it and love using the key to open the doors.As preschoolers, the idea is perfect. They don't need to know how to read and their level of learning can be at colors or shapes, beginning letters, or groups of 1, 2, or 3.Finding the balls is a joy to little kids and getting to use the key is super cool. When the treasure box opens, they are thrilled.I would recommend placing your child at the front of the game. Otherwise they can see sideways through the open doors to the bottom of the game and see if there are other balls nearby.They also always wanted to take the jewel out of the treasure chest but it is fixed in place. It would have been cool to have it removable.Sorry to see this game in limited availability but if you see it at a yard sale, pick it up! [SEP]"",""[CLS] We received this for a gift for my then 3 year old. It was so much fun. My kindergartener loved it and so did my friend's 18 month old. The kids pick a card and match the letter, color, shape with one of the doors. When they find a match, they use a key to open the door to see if they can find a ball. If they find the ball, they put it in a special hole. When enough balls fill that hole, a treasure chest opens. It looks made to have a non-competitive feel, with all kids working together to open the chest. However, competitive kids will find a way to compete, and my daughter decided the way to win was to be the first to open the chest. Younger kids like the 18 month old don't pay attention to the cards, they just poke around looking for the ball, but I could tell even she had the right idea.Pros:+educational, teaches letters, numbers and colors+can be played by one player or multiple players+two difficulty levels to provide appropriate challengeCons:-don't lose the balls or you won't be able to open the treasure chest-cards on doors can fall off easilySUMMARYExcellent preschool game for toddlers through kindergarteners.

Only good for a short while, but it serves it purpose in allowing children to learn and practice their number, letter, color, and turn-taking skills.

My daughter who is 6 loves to play it too & she can even play it with her brother without adult assistance since the rules are so simple & easy to follow.  The newer versions of this game now have a beginner level & an advanced level.  The advanced level is perfect for my 6 year old to play with us so it will stretch out the usefulness of this game for a few more years for my 3 year old son.  My only complaint is that the hidden balls are not so hidden once the surrounding doors are opened, then you can see if there is a ball under some of the doors before they have been opened.  It is no big deal really but if they could change one thing it should be to conceal the balls better.  But overall, this is a great game for families with young children!

I don't have a lot of space, didn't want to spend too much money, wanted something that would not fall apart, and needed to be able to put it out of reach of my curious dogs.Buying a dollhouse and then buying furniture separately, oh my, the sky is the limit on expense. That might be lots of fun in a different situation, but not good for mine.Then I find this dollhouse from Melissa & Doug, a company whose products I trust, and good information about it online. All wood, except I suppose the hair on the two dolls! But all the furniture and the house, wood, wood, wood. It folds easily and fits on a shelf, presto. The garage door opens--what a hoot that is!!! And no batteries!I just love this little dollhouse. Merry Christmas--to me!UPDATE:I've had this now for some months, and I use it every day! It is really well made, durable, and I've relocated it very easily a few times.I found some different dolls I like better, and added a few pieces of wood to vary the furniture. I boughtt one inexpensive piece at a craft store. Of course I had to add a dog, too! And at Christmas I added a Christmas tree, made of pipe cleaners and beads.My husband looks at it now and then to see what I'm doing with it. I bought a car at Toys R Us that fits into the garage, so his character leaves in it to go to work or on errands. And he and I both get into it at times, with the dog in the back seat.This is really a great doll house. I am so glad I found it. [SEP]","[CLS] Move in condition!

B000067QXC,"[CLS] New wood floors and two little babes... Yikes!  What to do?We bought 2 sets of these blue mats originally (sort of pricey, we thought) and ended up buying 2 more sets because we feel they are definitely worth it.  Our kids (3 and 1 years old) can roughhouse and learn to somersault without getting tearful.Rugs are an option we have used in other parts of the house, but they do not seem to provide as much cushion, and they do not clean up as easily when they are spilled on.  So far, a wet washcloth has worked fine on any food residue.One final note: Trucks roll gracefully and lego's and such have no problem standing up on the mats. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My wife and I bought these shortly after our twin boys started to move around.  We then bought more and more until basically our entire front room of hardwood was covered with these.  My boys are now 20 months and much more stable and we've finally removed these from the living room.Over the time we used them (about a year?), I think they worked great.  All through the unstable crawling, crusing, learning to walk period my twin boys fell on these too many times to count.  Other than suffering from a little shock, they never had an injury worth noting.  At the least, these saved mom and dad from a lot of worry.  At the most, they saved us from an ER visit or two.They were always easy to clean, soft to fall on, but firm enough to play with, and withstood the playtime of two rambunctious boys without tearing up.  Hard to complain about any of that.The negatives I do have are two items.  First, we bought these in batches over months of growth and not all of the batches seem to be made to the exact same specifications.  In other words, sometimes the squares from one batch wouldn't fit together exactly cleanly with the squares from another.  We made due, but it looked a little odd.  Second, on some squares, but not all, it would leave a slippery residue underneath the mat on the hardwood.  I never had a good explanation for that, but you see some other reviewers mention it.  It seemed to mostly not be a problem for most of our squares, but I see what other reviewers are saying.All in all, these were a big safety item for our boys as they got through that wobbly period.  They now sit in our basement and I'm not quite sure what to do with them next, but with two growing boys I'm sure a need for padding will come up somewhere soon. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is the second time I purchased the play mats. The mats latched to each other easily and easy to clean. It's good on the carpet. If you place it on smooth surface  floor, sometime sliding away when being walked on. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I have a concrete covered patio out back, and I bought two sets of these to go underneath a water table toy for my daughter. They are good quality, and I like having that extra cushion for safety. I'll probably buy a couple more sets to extend the play area. [SEP]"",""[CLS] These are very thick, durable and stay interlocked very well, even on carpet. Spills can leak between the interlocking tabs, so be forwarned. This product is much better than the cheaper versions with removable letters. I also put a set on the concrete patio under my son's baby pool for extra padding. It has saved a concrete to head collision several times, without a single tear! I highly recommend these! [SEP]"",""[CLS] These playmats are fantastic. They have cushion and yet are sturdy and durable. My son chews these mats like candy and yet they have kept their shape. They are great for little new crawlers that need alittle padding and resistance for their little knees. [...]Just a warning to new parents thinking of playmats. We have three sets (large family) and these are our favorite by far. All the other sets we have have shapes and numbers in them that come out. It is a huge pain when our son plays w/ these mats because you end up on your knee's trying to find the missing pieces all the time. Save your back, money, and time and just buy whole pieces without all the fancy decor (letters,numbers,animals, elct.) that comes out, they just end up missing or on the other side of the room out of the mat for you to pick up and figure out where it goes in the mat. Also the pieces get old and when you move the mat around all the pieces fall out everywhere, everytime you move it you have to put the whole puzzle back together.Glad to see reviews about sellers price forced them to lower their outrageous demands!!!

[SEP]"",""[CLS] BOUGHT FOR MY NEPHEW FOR CHRISTMAS BIG HIT [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this just because I always wanted one when I was a kid. It didn't disappoint. It was difficult to put together, but once together it is very solid. A great product. [SEP]"",""[CLS] One of my nephews just turned 9 and I got him this Airzooka as a gift. He seemed disappointed upon seeing the box, expecting something electronic I think. Once it was assembled though, and demonstrated to him, he was delighted. The air blast coming from the Airzooka carries a surprising distance, and the target feels for an instant as though he's been hit by something very soft. But there's nothing but a targeted gust of air, making this a much friendlier toy than a gun that shoots actual projectiles. I personally was charmed by the fact that this remarkable effect is generated without use of any batteries. The design is ingenious.Some reviews here have complained about the difficulty of assembling the airzooka. I found that assembly was easy, but the instructions were bad. At one point, they call for rotating the barrel of the gun, which I first took to mean rotating the lower part of the telescoping barrel relative to the upper parts. That isn't what they mean, and in fact they could just have said extend the telescoping barrel all the way and saved the confusion. Assembly takes one wide-tip screwdriver (I actually used a narrow chisel), and took about five minutes.The only bad news about this toy, from my point of view, is that it is loud. Parents are typically going to want to restrict it to outdoor use as a result.I plan to buy a second Airzooka next month for another nephew; they are going to love having air wars with each other.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] this is a very good, very fun toy. for those of you who do not know how it shoots a ball of air 40 feet,(yes, 40 feet!!!) it fires a fairly large toroidal vortex, a doughnut of spinning air that has very low air resistance.  it is a little tricky to assemble, but i got it together in a few minutes. try putting the top plate on first. once you get the screws in place, it is very sturdy.this is very fun. it can blast hair, curtains, christmas trees, important paper documents, pets, dust, siblings, etc. very effectively. the flip-up sights are really accurate. it has quite a kick to it when you fire, and requires moderate strength to pull back into firing position. the plastic membrane that pushes the air gets wrinkled quite a bit, but it has held up so far.  if you stick some incense into it for a good 15 seconds, you can see the vortex, or smoke ring, travel through the air (make sure you ease the membrane forward, not release it!). i calculated the speed of the vortex at 20 mph. it is actually so powerful that my mom banned me from shooting it at people, because it feels like someone hit you with a pillow.  overall, i recommend this to anyone 10 and up with a lot of stuff around the house to shoot. most fun toy i've ever had!P.S. if you shoot it at a wall, you can hear a 'pfft' from it hitting the wall, and it whistling through the air directly before.

Second, it also adds to the strategy component in three distinct but not to complex ways: (1) inns -- which cause roads completed during the game to score double, but incomplete roads with inns to score nothing at the end of the game; (2) cathedrals -- which cause cities completed during the game to score 1 more point per tile/pennant, but incomplete cities with cathedrals to score nothing at the end of the game; and (3) a big meeple that counts as two meeples.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] Carcassonne: Traders and Builders is another fine expansion to augment the base game though it's sort of unfocused, having several unrelated features in one expansion.  In addition to the tiles and new meeple types, you get a cloth tile bag to hold your tiles instead of having to stack them.  The bag is JUST big enough to fit the base game, Inns and Cathedrals, and this expansion.  The new components:  A pig (1 per color);  A pig can be placed on a farmland that you've already claimed, giving one extra point for each city that utilizes that farmland.  A Builder (1 per color);  A Builder can be placed on an existing city or road that you've already claimed.  Each time you add a new tile to that entity, you are allowed to take one bonus tile from supply and place it where you choose.  There is a maximum of one bonus tile per turn.  Trader tiles:  There are city tiles that contain a picture of one of three goods - cloth, ribbons, and wheat.  Whoever places the last tile to complete a city that contains one or more of these goods acquires chits for each good within the city.  At the end of the game, a 10-point bonus for each good is awarded to the player who has the most of that good.  So it can be very worthwhile to complete your opponent's city in some cases.  This expansion really adds a lot to the game, so if you want to add something new to your game, this is a wonderful set to do that with.  If you're teaching a new player, you can always take away the builders, pigs, and chits to simplify things (and ignore the goods printed on the tiles).  My wife and I love the Builders and the Traders, but are indifferent about the pig, as it really adds very little. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is my favorite expansion pack for Carcassonne.  It changes the dynamic of cities by adding commodity points to them and gives a player that 2nd turn if they've got a builder on a road.  It's a really good expansion for the game and perhaps my favorite one. [SEP]"",""[CLS] One of my more favorite expansions.. It does have a commodities element which I first feared would make it too much like resources in Settlers, but it is totally different. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a good expansion for Carcassonne (you *cannot* play this as a stand-alone game, you *must* have Carcassonne already!)Each color (including gray) gets two new meeples, a pig and a builder. The pig is added to a farm for +1 point for every city (regardless of whether you're playing with the new rules or the old ones). The builder is added to a city or road that you already possess, and allows you to take an extra turn (no more than one extra turn-per-turn) every time you add a tile to said city or road. (Oh, it's great fun to close somebody's city for them right after they added their builder, thus robbing them of their chance to get their extra turn!)There also are many cities with 'trade goods' in them - cloth, wine, or grain. The person who completes a city with trade goods in them - not necessarily the person who owns that city - gets the goods. At the end of the game, the person with the most in each good gets extra points. Oh, is it ever fun to close somebody's city and get a sweet, sweet reward!

Take Carcassonne to new levels of excitement with this fun expansion pack. Traders can eanr players extra points and builders enable players to place extra tiles, allowing the cities and roads to grow faster. A pig, properly placed, can enrich the value of a farm. Also included is a small cloth bag for the tiles, making it easier to shuffle and draw them during the game.

We got this solely because of the Thomas theme, and thought it would be a fun introduction to one of my favorite childhood card games. While the jumbo sized cards are nice, it's not any easier for my kids to hold in their hands -- they just lay them down in front of them anyway (for all to see). And this bigger size makes them more difficult to shuffle. Positive: Great way for children to learn about taking turns and matching different cards, plus strategy (when to use the Diesel Wild card). My kids have occasionally even played this game all by themselves, without me or their Daddy. (They just can't shuffle.) We also now have an older-kid-version of UNO cards (Doc McStuffins w/ a draw four, skip, reverse) and they easily learned that version.

B00008W73Z,"[CLS] These Snap Circuit sets have been recommended to me by other involved parents since my son entered preschool. At first I was resistant to buying one of these circuit sets for him for the reasons below but eventually I decided to order one and then let my son experiment without saying anything just to observe his interest and learning curve. Over the past few months or so, my son has worked through perhaps 50 of the circuits (although, most children could build all the circuits in the manual in a few days if they so desired) and enjoys seeing what the next project will entail. As I have watched him put together the circuits and experiment, I have formed two different opinions about the Snap Circuit sets, with one centered on using the Snap Circuits set to introduce circuits to small children and the other detailing the actual learning of basic circuit principles.With regards to getting children interested in circuits and making simple circuits, I give the Snap Circuits sets five stars. The kits are well laid out and properly labeled. The components are nice and bright and appealing to small minds and eyes. The components are made so they easily snap on to each other and many given circuits can be snapped together in under three minutes or so. The instruction manuals are pretty easy to understand and can be followed by almost all children. Because of the manner in which the components are built, doing any of the projects is simply a matter of looking at the diagram in the manual and then snapping in the right components to the base plastic background frame (think of it as a child's version of the breadboard). Immediately children can be up and running with simple lighting circuits, fan circuits, speaker circuits, etc.... They receive a very visceral feeling of accomplishment from touching the circuit and seeing what it can do (seeing a fan spin or a speaker make unusual tones). That feeling of being able to put something together and then have it work is magic to little kids and is the strong point of the Snap Circuits sets.With regards to actually teaching your child about the principles behind electric circuits and why they work in the manner they do, I would give Snap Circuits roughly two stars. That is because real circuits are based on basic electrical principles of voltage, current, resistance, wattage, etc... and require the mathematical tools from simple algebra up to differential equations and complex variables to fully get it. For example, in the manual, you do get to build a simple charging circuit with a capacitor but the manual only gives a few sentences as to how the capacitor stores and releases charge. They do not explain anything in detail about how a time constant is derived or the importance of differential equations in relation to truly understanding the time constant. Nowhere in my son's manual is the most basic equation of electrical circuits even mentioned (V=IR, voltage equals current times resistance). So the reader is not exposed to the basic fundamental physical and mathematical relations that are critically important to circuit construction. That means that the Snap Circuit sets are essentially LEGOs, that allow children of average ability or above to blindly snap together a circuit without having any idea what a resistor is doing for the circuit or why a capacitor is needed in a particular location. So a child could easily over the course of a month snap together dozens of circuits but then if you ask that child, What is a transistor and how does it work?, you are likely to be met with a blank stare. Another small ding against Snap Circuits is their use of several integrated circuits (ICs) that to children seem like one simple component (for example, the blue Music IC which makes sounds and tones) when in fact ICs are often extremely complex combinations of dozens to thousands of simpler circuit components.Therefore, I am a bit torn as to how to rate these Snap Circuit kits. Overall, I feel they do a great job of getting small children immediately involved hands on and giving them a sense of accomplishment. The Snap Circuit kits are also far easier than other hobbyist kits for getting kids into circuits and electricity in general. That said, I think the rightful place of the Snap Circuit sets is as an introductory primer that can set the stage for them to advance to a little bit more adult circuit setup (like the Elenco 300 in 1 Electronic Project Lab). So that a child can use these Snap Circuits from say age 6 to 8 and then transition to real breadboard circuits at age 9 to 12 as their ability to understand the underlying mathematical and physical principles advance. Overall I would give these kits four stars and think they are great for smaller children. However as your child advances and especially if they become interested in why a circuit works as it does, then you will likely find yourself seeking out a more advanced hobbyist set (and some mathematics and physics books as well). [SEP]"",""[CLS] A big hit with my oldest son.  He really loves that he can make projects on his own and he loves building things and showing them to his friends.

He loves to share with his family what he has done with each project.The other great thing about snap circuits is the learning.  At first when we worked on projects and would ask him what he thought would happen or what different alterations to each project would do, he didn't know, now as he has worked through several projects he has his own hypothesizes about what will happen as you make changes to the projects and try different things. I can see that my kid is starting to get the basics of working with electronics and building a foundation for more learning later.

Once your child gets the hang of this, the sky is the limit -- they can do multiple projects on the same circuits.  This set has lights, flying saucers, recording devices, many switches, and several motors.  It's a complete set -- the starter kits for Snap Circuits can all be built with this master set.Simply excellent.

Very fun game with a group of people. It also came fast and with all pieces. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I've played Buzzword in my Wednesday gaming group since it came out around 2005 or so. Each card is double sided and has ten things that contain a common word or name. Two teams alternate in trying to come up with answers in a 45-second time limit. If the buzzword is Rock:Music that Elvis and Little Richard are pioneers of - Rock & RollHard chewing sweet stuff - Rock candyPlayed McMillan on TV - Rock HudsonPrudential company's trademark symbol - Rock of GilbraltarYou get the idea. Team play is good, because often two, three or four heads are better than one. When time is up, the other team gets five seconds for each clue you passed on or didn't get to. Each correct answer is one point. The first team to get 50 points wins, but both teams get the same amount of turns, so if the team that went first gets 50 points first, the other team should get a final turn to try to tie or beat them, unless the first team has more than a 10-point lead, making a tie impossible.This a fun and fast paced game that keeps you on your toes mentally.

There is a timer, so the quicker and clearer the reader can give clues and the quicker the team guesses the better chance they have of getting all 10 words.It is loads of fun.  Having a team makes it especially great because there is usually gonna be someone that comes through in the clutch when everyone else is stumped.

B00009IM5W,"[CLS] My son is a beginning yo-yoer.  The old classic, Duncan, gave out right away, so we decided to try this one.  It is perfect for him.  He is learning to do a few tricks, and it is very easy for him to do the simple, up-down-up-down with this yo yo.  It comes with very basic instructions and an extra sting, which is nice.  It comes apart for repair....how many people have lost a yo-yo due to a tangled string on the inside that cannot be accessed to get fixed?  Problem solved!  His little brother has already thumped it into the floor a few times, and it is still going strong, so this is definitely a win! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I have played with Yo-Y0's ever since I was about 10,over 60 years ago. In those days,Duncan was the big name for good Yo-Yo's. They were made of wood and had a fixed wood axel. When I first saw the Fireball,somewhere over 15 years ago,I was completely blown away. Over the years the Yo-Yo craze has become widespread and fades away;only to become a craze a number of years later. With each craze,new design and improvements appear. However with the last craze ,the advancements in Yo-Yo's has been astounding. Yomega has led in the design and manufacture of Yo-Yo's. Plastics and metal have outstripped wood Yo-Yo's and the fixed wood axle has been replaced by metal and incorporating various types of bearings,nylon ,plastic and even ball bearings. Electronics have also been introduced that count tricks,lights have given excitement,particularly in the dark. And some Yo-Yo's are also even musical. There are a lot of real good Yo-Yo's to choose from;but there are a lot of real cheap junky stuff around,particularly in places like Dollar StoresI have a large collection of Yo-Yo's and without exception,Yomega Yo-Yo's are all excellent and are some of my favorites. The Yo-Yo's today allow one to perform tricks that are much more difficult or impossible than with Yo-Yo's of the past. String tricks with Yo-Yo's are made easier when the Yo-Yo has a long spin or sleep time. This Yo-Yo goes by the name Auto Return because it has a built in clutch .So,it is very easy for any beginner. This clutch makes the Yo-Yo come back up or return automatically once it slows down enough for the clutch to engage. This feature has one drawback. Many tricks require one to make a Yo-Yo sleep for some extended time,but you can't control the sleep time with auto return Yo-Yo's ;so this is a poor choice for fancy,extended or string tricks. Some other Reviewers have commented that the quality is somewhat lacking. I have had mine for a long time and find it of excellent quality as are my others manufactured by Yomega. [SEP]"",""[CLS] As far as yoyos go, this one is rather cool.  It was a gift for my grandson.  He got so many other things for Christmas that he hasn't gotten into this yet, but I think he will enjoy it.

When you hit the target, it makes fun sounds and announces goal!  If your kid wants it removed, you can easily snap it off. My 6 year old just started Soccer and this has been perfect for him to practice aiming in the center of the net or the sides.

We found using the setting with just hitting the net wasn't that great because it cheers if only vibrated. Also we did have to bend the target so you had to hit it to get the crowd to cheer.

A must have. I liked it so much that I pre-ordered the new ABC one for another grandson. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This see-and-say is very small for the amount of animals on it.  My 18 month son doesn't quite understand the the arrow is pointing at the animals since it is so busy to look at.

It really worked to keep her busy during a plane ride I took with her by myself at 17 months!  She goes around saying e-i-e-i-o all the time and loves pulling the handle.  Although, she is usually looking for the song.  Keeps her busy on car rides, too! [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a really cute toy and a good idea.  But when you turn the page it doesn't recognize the new animals.  It will say the animal that is in that spot when the page is turned the other way.  For example the sheep is at the top left when the page is on the left.  Then when you turn it and there's a cat in that spot it still says sheep.  I would think this would get very confusing and frustrating for a child who is just learning their animals and sounds.  Maybe I just got a defective one... [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this for our daughter when she was 13 months old, but she really can't work with it alone until now (18months).  The sounds are good, and there are two sets of animals.  The only problem is that the handle is a little too strong for little hands, so they need someone's help to pull the lever.  Otherwise, she loves it.  It works well for animal recognition and sounds. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I loved the old version of this toy and purchased it for my two kids, now 4 yr. and 20 months.  They liked it for the first hour and now rarely play with it.  I am hoping my 20 month will enjoy it at some point but we purchased it a year ago.  They usually enjoy the things we buy but this wasn't a hit for some reason. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The recommended age for See 'n Say is 18 months, but we bought it anyway.  Our seven-month old recently started enjoying animal noises we'd make for him.  I tried this toy for him in the store and was greeted with the same smile and giggle we got from quacking like a duck for him at home.  He is probably far from learning how to pull the handle himself, but we do it for him and he watches with delight.  Each night, we read him a few stories before bed and we use See 'n Say the Farmer Says as if it were a book.  We hold it in front of my son and pull the handle a few times to hear animal sounds and he thinks he just heard a fabulous tale.This toy has a half ring that can be flipped back and forth to display different animals.  There are 16 animals, which are named and make their individual sounds when the handle is pulled.  There is also a song sticker that plays Old MacDonald had a Farm or The Farmer in the Dell.  And there is a quiz sticker that asks you to find the animal based on the name of the animal or its sound.  The farmer is on an arrow in the middle and you point it toward whichever sticker you want and then pull the handle.I only have two minor complaints with this toy.  The handle sometimes sticks on the way back up and makes a soft grinding sound.  Also, the volume is a bit loud and there is no volume control button.  Overall, it's a great toy.

We used them in all of our school art classes.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] As an experienced watercolour artist, I wanted my 5-year old Grandaughter to be able to use good quality 'kids' paints.  These are far better than Crayola, but be aware that some colours are not 'washable' and will stain if they get on clothing or carpets.  Colours are vibrant and lift from the pans well...like most of these types of paints, they will turn to jelly if they are kept wet for a long painting session, so I purchased two sets and change them out after each work of art so that they get time to dry out a bit and not turn to mush.  I know that some adult artists like to use these for sketching purposes too. [SEP]"",""[CLS] great [SEP]"",""[CLS] My goodness where to start?  Prang watercolors have been around for years and years.  I have been around for years and years; not as long as Prang, but long enough.  I can remember using them when I first started and that was actually in the late 1940s.  Since that time I have progressed beyond smearing colors around a piece of paper until I arrive at a glorious dark mess that sort of runs off the paper but that my mom said was beautiful anyway.  Well, truth be told, I have not progressed much beyond that, but there never-the-less has been some little improvement and I suspect my mom would still tell me my messes are beautiful; her, if no one else.Anyway, over the years I have used a lot of different paint.  Some of the paint has been obscenely expensive...professional grade and all that.  Some of these paints were very nice; no doubt about it. I still use them often.  But I have to tell you that I have never stopped using Prang and continually come back to it.  You simply cannot beat the intensity of color and blendability, and you certainly cannot beat the cost for the quality you are getting.  As so often happens, the snob appeal overrides our logic and good judgment...sometimes cheaper is indeed better; or at least just as good.These paints are absolutely ideal for the beginner (In reference to the particular set being reviewed here).  You are given a large enough palate so that the beginning student is not overwhelmed with trying as many different blends as you are with the smaller selections.  These paints are ideal to use in a school setting as the clean up is a snap and if the student is half way good, then their painting will look pretty darn fine also.  I find with the broader choice and the pop the color gives, the incentive to keep going is much greater for younger students.As to older students...due to cost this is an ideal set.  If they find out that watercolor is simply not for them, then there is no great loss.  When teaching I dislike very much having to share paint (One of my personal hang-ups) and these are ideal for that.One tip though.  The brush that they include with this set is horrid and down right useless.  Go ahead and spring for some nicer brushes....hey; you save so much on the paint, you should be able to afford it.Also remember, if you are just starting out, or if you are teaching...even the little ones, a good quality paper is a very, very wise investment!Love these paints.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks [SEP]","[CLS] Since 1882 Prang Art & Craft solutions maintained an uncompromised quality to ignite the passion of our valued creative customers.

B000161RFA,"[CLS] Hours of entertainment..... Everyone loved watching it do things and walking through the house.  Bought for an 8yr old, but loved by all crowds of people.  Fairly easy to work, but a little hard to program.  We just play with the commands it came with which is very efficient. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My boys 6 and 3 love this guy. Tons of fun. battery life is great. Bought it at christmas and still haven't had to change them yet. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Great Toy. My 6 years old son get it on his birthday and since than love it. Robot can dance, make some noisy sounds like roar, whistle, give five and so on. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I'm a tech lover.  I love tech gadgets, toys, products, books...everything tech, I really enjoy.Nearly 10 years ago WowWee introduced the first Robosapien.  I remember seeing one in a store and thinking about how awesome it looked, and how much fun it would be to have a small walking robot around the house.  I never ended up getting one, and I watched as the Robosapien left, to be replaced by the Robosapien V2, then the Roboraptor, and even more products.  I never did end up getting one of them, but I still always thought that they'd be a fun toy to have to mess around with.Well, fast forward nearly 10 years, and what do I see when I'm walking through Toys R Us??  That's right...Robosapien X.  There it was, in all of it's original glory...but with another little part in the box that looked as if it should plug into a headphone jack.I purchased the only one they had on the shelf and went home, to figure out what the Robosapien was all about.Turns out, that little part that looks like it should plug into a headphone jack is exactly that, a piece that plugs into your smartphone or tablet and runs an app that controls the Robosapien X much like it's standard remote control, but with less programming type features.The Robosapien X is apparently being released as a bit of a 10 Year Anniversary type of product, from what I've been able to gather from reading about it.  The X, it would seem then, is the Roman numeral 10 in this instance.  The product itself, including the Robosapien and the standard remote are identical to the original Robosapien.  I've read that some of the differences in other versions of Robosapien have to do with how long it will run programs for and such, and I've found that the X runs them for the same length of time as the original, so I'm of the mind that this is exactly...literally exactly...the same product that came to market back in 2004.  (What I mean by how long it will run programs is the TIME that it will run a type of program before putting itself to sleep)The small dongle that's included in the package is used to control the Robosapien with your phone or tablet.  I've found this to work really well, especially if you are just controlling the Robosapien and not worrying about inputing any actual programs.  In fact, for simple control the App control with the dongle is, in my opinion, superior to the remote because you don't have to worry about using the select button which functions like a shift key on a keyboard.  Basically, with the normal remote each key has three functions, and which function it is using depends on whether or not you've pressed Select, and even how many times you've pressed Select.  With the App, you just swipe to the side and quickly get yourself at the second set of commands...no Select required.  It works wonderfully for controlling the Robosapien as if it were a remote controlled vehicle.I do wish that the App had the ability to work with the programming...but as best I can tell, it does not.  There is, however, a catch to this.  The App has a record feature, that will record every button that you press and store it.  You can then play that recording, and the Robosapien will follow the instructions that you have input into the App.  There seems to be no limit to the number of moves that you can record, so theoretically this would allow for limitless programming and endless control of the Robosapien.  In practice, though, it's not as solid of a solution for some types of things.For instance, for dancing...it works great.  You can have the Robosapien do whatever you want, then play the recorded routine and set the phone down and it will just keep dancing and dancing...but the thing is, it can always see the IR from the dongle on the phone.  However, if you have saved a routine that has him wandering around, if he ever wanders out of the range or view of the IR dongle, then he will just stop doing anything, even though the recording is still running on the phone.This is in contrast to programming using the remote that he comes with.  When using this, things like dance routines are limited in how long they can be by the number of commands that Robosapien can remember.  However, you can program him to wander around autonomously, using his various touch sensors to tell him when he's hit something so he can back up and turn around, and this doesn't require any input from any remote, nor does it require being able to constantly see the IR from a remote.  The limit to this, however, is time.  The Robosapien will stop running it's program after five minutes...that can be overcome by a press of a button on the remote from time to time, but it is a limit.  I'm not really fond of the five minute limit, as I'd love to be able to just put the Robosapien into a roaming mode and let him wander around to his heart's content, but it's not a really big deal.The Robosapien does the things that it's supposed to do very well.  It walks on low pile carpet and hardwood/tile floors very well.  He can get around on thicker carpet, but it's not as quick or as smooth.  He also moves his arms around very easily, and will grab and throw the cup that he comes with almost every time, provided you have positioned him correctly to be able to grab it.  His dance routines that you can come up with can become pretty intricate, especially when using the App to have endless control.  He also makes some sounds that children would probably think are hilarious.  The touch sensors on his feet and hands work perfectly, and when programmed to do so can tell the Robosapien to do an action when they are activated.  It's fun to command him to wander around, and control his movement, and even more so if you have pets.  One of my dogs seems like he's constantly trying to play with the Robosapien, where both of my cats are pretty freaked out by it.  Again, for simply controlling the Robosapien, I can't stress enough how much more I enjoy using the App than the remote it comes with.  It's just a better option for total control over the little thing.Once the novelty of controlling the Robosapien X with the App or the remote wears off, it might seem like it's time to put it on the shelf and forget about it.  One of the initial problems that some people might have with Robosapien is that after a few short hours, it seems like more of a toy and less of a robot.  This, however, can be remedied with some reading and looking around.  Once you start to realize how in depth programs can get, even if they are limited by the number of commands, you can still end up with some pretty interesting things, and it does start to seem a bit more like a robot at that point.  I found that there are plenty of spots online where you can find different programs to put into the Robosapien, but I also found one resource that has been great.<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/The-Robosapien-Companion-Tricks-Technology/dp/1590595262/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>The Robosapien Companion Tricks Technology</a>That's a book written a few years back with tips, tricks, programs, and hacks for the original Robosapien.  Seeing as the Robosapien X IS just and original Robosapien, I've found that every single piece of information in the book directly pertains to the newest Robosapien.  The programs all work, the tips and tricks all work, everything.  Not only does the book contain some fun programs and tips for how to come up with your own, it has some information about hacking the Robosapien to make it better, more fun, or just more unique.  These range from simple tear down instructions all the way to a detailed instruction set for how to install a wireless camera into the Robsapien that broadcasts it's video to a TV or computer.  It also includes some fun information about how Robosapien came to be, and robotics in general.  It truly is a good companion to have, and really does kind of make Robosapien into less of a toy and more of an actual robot.Overall, I'm extremely happy with the Robosapien X.  It's everything I hoped it would be...however, there are a couple of drawbacks, none of which I feel detract from the overall score of the product.First, the IR remote that he comes with can be a bit finicky.  I've noticed during programming that sometimes I have to hit buttons a few times for it to register them.  Luckily, when programming it makes an audible sound when the command is recognized, so you know when you've missed one.That IR remote also can be troublesome when using it in bright daylight, even indoors.  I didn't notice this AS much with the IR dongle for the App, but it was still present.  Robosapien is an indoors kind of guy, so close the curtains and have at it without having to worry about the sunlight messing with any IR.It's also pretty loud.  I wish there were a volume control, so that you could turn the sounds it makes down, or even off.  There's no way that anyone is going to want this toy being used at night while they are trying to sleep.  It's simply too loud.Finally, I don't like that every time you turn the Robosapien off, any program you've given him will be erased.  This seems to me like something that could have been addressed and updated with this version.  I know that back when it was first released they were using very little onboard memory...but it seems to me that this is a missed opportunity with the Robosapien X.  There's no reason it shouldn't be able to remember it's programming so that the next time you turn it on, you can just have it start running a program that you worked on before you turned it off.Even with these few drawbacks, I've found my time with the Robosapien X to be really fun.  It's funny, controls well, and uses some basic programming to provide quite a few smiles.  I recommend it as a tech gadget, toy, or robot...whaver you fancy calling it!!

All our nieces and nephew love it when they come over!! Great brand great product!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Many years ago we got our daughter a full power model when she was about 3. It actually had room for her brother, too. Being grandparents we knew one day our grandson would get one. We thought a one year old was too soon until we found this.He already knows how to get on the ride. He also knows that he needs to push the button by his thumb to make it go. So is he still too young? Not at all. He's finding his way around and as fast as we've seen him accomplish other tasks it won't be long before he's buzzing about the house on this thing. Fortunately it's not that fast so it is a great starter.It would be nice if it had reverse but he should be supervised anyway and I think it will be a while before he picks up that concept of what different buttons do even though he is getting there with some of the other toys he has this thing moves so not necessarily safe to give him too many options.But overall for the price this is an excellent and fun toy for starting out.

Tip of the tongue is a game of trivia in which each person has only 2 seconds to answer the question.

As soon as the question is asked the questioner pushes a button and 2 seconds later the buzzer goes off.  The fun is all in seeing whether or not you can quickly spout out the answer.A hard candy with a hole in the middle.  What color are the Simpsons?  What is the Japanese currency?

B0001CU1QA,"[CLS] The kids each got one of these at Christmas and began squirreling away all the loose coins they found around the house and car. Squeeze the coins through the top slot and it correctly tallies up the total. The small reset hole near the battery compartment allows you to to clear the toal and start over from scratch. I wish it also had some kind of manual way to add dollar increments to the total---sometimes the kid wants to stuff a $5-10-20 bill gift in the jar, and we have to manually shove quarters through the slot to equal the value of the bill. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This jar works great -- hasn't skipped a beat in keeping perfect count. I bought one for my husband and one for my seven year-old niece. I reviewed all the fancy coin counters that sort and wrap the coins, hoping I would find something really great. But every review for those fancy (non- commercial) sorters/counters moaned on about how it didn't recognize the coins every time or didn't keep an accurate count. For my husband, I wanted something he could put his pocket change into instead of plastic margarine tubs stored under our bed. I also wanted something to keep track of the amount of change so when it got high enough we could cash it out and have dinner or gas up both cars, etc. For my niece, I wanted to promote saving by watching the dollar amount rise as she dropped her coins in over time. This jar works really well for both purposes. It hasn't skipped a beat yet in keeping count of the change or knowing what coin was being dropped in. It's got a great big jar attached so it will hold a lot (probably a couple hundred dollars worth of change, easy) but is small enough to fit unassumingly onto any counter or side table. It's made of a heavy plastic material so it'll stand up to a beating and it's easy to grip for small hands, or even for an older relative whose hands might be shaky. I have no complaints about this -- it works great and fits the bill. No more margarine tubs under the bed! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this for my girls and I love it!  It really does properly count the money.  The only thing it doesn't count are half dollars (who uses those anyway LOL).  The actual product is made out of a hard plastic; seems very durable and the kid's can see their money while it is being counted.  I bought this for a lot cheaper from collections etc. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I think all of us have a money jar of some sort in our house.  We need that jar in case we need spare change, or need to put spare change somewhere.  In some cases, people use money jars as a swear jar (if someone says a bad word they have to put money in the jar).  A swear jar is a good way to teach teenagers some respect.  Of course they wait until you go to bed just to take the money right back (and also take your car).  But the important thing is that teens and adults both understand how useful these jars are.In my experience snooping around, I find that people don't always put the money jar in the same place in their homes.  Some people put them in their hallway, other people (like me) put them right next to the computer.  I think the most logical place would be to set them on the hutch, or wherever you put pictures of your family.  Put the money jar right there.As people below have mentioned, there is something fascinating about emptying your money jar and counting how much money you have.  I sit here and look at the jar next to me and see mostly quarters and pennies.  I bet I could buy 10 pizzas.  I don't recommend shoving paper money in there, because the only way to get it back out would be to break the whole jar open with a hammer (unless you're an expert with tweezers).There's only so much you can say about a money jar.  Please, purchase one if you haven't already.  No matter what the jar looks like, you can't go wrong.  You'll be surprised how often you put money in and take money out of one. [SEP]"",""[CLS] After purchasing the ATM Safe for our son, we purchased the Money Jar to keep in the kitchen.  It is a good tool to help teach the kids the value of money.  Now we designate the money in the jar for something special - say a trip to Chuck E. Cheese's.  The kids can watch the savings grow and anticipate what the reward will be for saving.  They are also learning delayed gratification and patience as well as the hard lesson that you can't get everything that you want NOW.  Not bad!!The only negative - if you don't force each coin into the slots, they can pop back out and the jar registers a deposit for the coin even though it didn't actually make it in the jar. [SEP]","[CLS] Kids will love saving their allowance in this&#8212;and will learn how pennies add up over time.

So far, my kids love this easel and I am so glad that it has the dry erase portion. My youngest has issues with math, and since he loves using the board, I have an easier time getting him to concentrate and become excited about practicing math.To go with the easel, I got the Alex Ultimate Accessories Painting pack and it works wonderfully with this easel.

It was easy to assemble and I can see that this will be something that will be used well past when she starts school (for playing school etc).For now (she's just under 2 years) it is currently being used by her for art work and design projects LOL, and the white board for magnetic letters numbers etc. Using markers of the white board will be for when she gets older. She uses it every day without being directed as well.Very worthwhile purchase. We paid $99.00 in December 2013, but price has risen by 15% as of this post. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I wanted an easel with a dry erase board that was also magnetic surface. I figured my kids (4 & 2 now, 2 & 12 mo when I bought this) wouldn't use the dry erase feature until they were older, but might enjoy a place to play with their plastic magnet letters and other magnet toys. Well, they really haven't done either. No dry erase markers, and no magnets. Instead I attach a big sheet of paper to each side and they paint or color with crayons or markers (both washable.)  I won't say they've never used magnets or dry earse markers or chalk, I just mean the vast majority of the times they use the eaasel, they want paper on it. And the paper grasp clips that come with the easel are pitiful, crappy things. I use large sized chip clips and the jumbo office binder clips to keep the paper in place. Like other reviewers I've had an issue with the screw peg caps coming off, and never going back on. I guess the threading is stripped, as ridiculous as that seems to me based on the gentle way in which they have been utilized by us. Again, I just think they are really crappy to begin with, like they were a designers last minute decorative touch that lacks any reasonable hardware functionality. Having said all that, I will also say that my kids enjoy the easel. it's a great creative outlet for them, and it is not in danger of collapsing or toppling over or anything similar, as far as I can tell. Also it's aesthetically pleasing, which for me means it's a traditional looking wooden easel instead of a big, unsightly hunk of molded plastic.

Not sure how much the pervious owner played with it, but between us and them it's holding up well. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We've had this game for quite awhile.  It's a gas.  You have a hammer, you pick one of the silly little moles in front of you to whack, you turn the game on to either solo, easy or hard and go at her.  The easy game the moles helmets light up and you have a distinct sound that signals you're mole is lighting.  On the hard game there is no light and the game makes the sound of your mole to signal the whacking.The game keeps score for you.  Everytime you whack correctly you are awarded points, every time you whack incorrectly the game deducts points.  You play to 100 to win, there are bonus whacks announced and anyone can whack their mole.The sounds are all different and silly, barking dog, meowing cat, yoo hoo, a silly boingy sound.  The sounds change per mole whenever you play, you won't have the same sound each time, causing you to really pay attention.We have been whacking on this game for about 3 years now.  I've yet to change the batteries.  My son, at 7, is probably too old for it now, but it still makes us giggle on a rainy afternoon.If you have aggressive children you may want to think twice about handing them a hammer and encouraging them to whack the moles.  Also if you have poor sports you may want to set up some hammer ground rules.After 3 years of whacking we still have the game and hammers intact.

It's different than the old time game you played at arcades.  The moles don't pop up but rather their heads light up quickly and you have to pound them on the heads with the plastic hammers before the light goes out.

He loves the sounds they make and even my 1 year old tries to play!  She grabs the mallet and starts whacking...not necessarily the moles either LOL.  The game is a blast!  If you want a game everyone can play and enjoy, this is it! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My son has been asking for this game for weeks, so we got it for him for Christmas. I admit, I thought it might be cheaply made, not to mention aggravating just by virtue of the whacking.The moles themselves do not pop up. Rather, a light under their helmets go off, as well as a specific sound (for the easy game). For the hard game, it's sound only.Initially, there is a sign in period where you whack the mole that you want to be yours. This tells the game how many are playing (unless you chose the solo game). You are then told to listen for the sound of your particular mole. Each game, the sound is different. It could be a bird whistle, a cat's meow, a dog bark, Duh!, Yoohoo!, Yeah!, etc. You're then told to listen for the bonus sound.You get a point when you whack your own mole, as well as when you whack your mole when the bonus sound is made. At the end of the game, you're told who won, and how many points each player got.My son is 6, and is sometimes not quick enough. But this game is great for reflexes, hand/eye coordination, etc. It's a blast to play, and my son enjoys it, too...sometimes even requesting the hard version! (although it's even more challenging for him to play audio only). Because the sounds change every game, it teaches listening skills and keeps the game fresh.The plastic hammers are really soft, so they won't do a whole lot of damage should your child choose to use them elsewhere! We've banged the heck out of this game so far, and have had no trouble with its performance...it works perfectly.Highly recommended!

When I saw this game, I knew my daughter would love it and I was right.  I don't think I've ever seen her this excited about a toy.The game is divided into four parts: the Frog Pond in which you have to flip plastic frogs into a pond, the Snack Hut in which you roll dice and try to get four matching snacks, Letter Lake in which you get a word and then fish for letters to spell out that word, and Tumble Tides in which you get a picture and have to push levers on tumblers in an attempt to match your picture.  All four have educational and/or developmental value as they encourage spelling, object manipulation, picture matching, etc.  You score points for your progress at each game and for each point you get a balloon.  The player who fills his/her float with balloons first wins.Both of the Cranium games that I have purchased for my daughter have proved that educational games can be both lively and fun but, of the two, this one is my favorite.  The game is very fast-paced, which is great for short attention spans.  Each game lasts only seconds and since each player spins the carousel in the middle to determine which game they play, there is a lot of variety and an element of surprise and anticipation.  My husband and I had a lot of fun playing the game with my daughter and anything that encourages family time gets high marks from me.  I'm so pleased with the two Cranium games I've purchased that I plan on spreading the word to family and friends with kids and I definitely plan on purchasing more of these games. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My daughter received this last Christmas and it has been a hit ever since.  And, it's one of those games that you don't mind playing as a parent.  It's easy to learn, durable, and appropriate for kids 4 to 9. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is really fun using left brain, right brain, motor skills etc so that no one needs to be left behind.  The concept is simple with four different and equally fun, challenging activities some of which are just as challenging for adults!We just play the music twice for younger ones sort of like a golf handicap -- This would be one of the must have games for your pre-k and up child.  A year after owning this toy, we still bring it out often and play at least a 3-4 rounds.The original version of cadoo and hullabaloo too has been outgrown by my now 5 yr old son but this continues to engage.Durability wise, I gave it a 4 mainly because of a ton of small pieces which tend to get lost. but no different than hungry hippo marbles or hi ho cherrys :-) [SEP]"",""[CLS] This game is such fun, total eye candy to look at and play! I have 4 & 5 yr olds who took to this game like ducks to water. The game is totally durable and has a great thick, strong, divider filled box to store all the game pieces neatly in. The premise of the game is interesting and festive; kids will feel like they're taking a stroll through a small town midway carnival. That being said, I would be surprised if the older than 8 group would find this game exciting at all--it's probably ideal for ages 4-7.  The games are based more on chance and luck, and require only minimal skill. My family loves Cranium games and this is an outstanding new comer for the younger kids! Cranium Hullabaloo is a superb activity game, but for those times when a more traditional board game is desired this is a super fun innovative alternative! It will be a sure fire hit and worth every penny! [SEP]","[CLS] Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, step right up to this amazing game!

B00020V4Y4,"[CLS] Talk about bang for your buck!  17 high-quality instruments for only 30 dollars?  It doesn't get much better than this!Modern toys are often noisy.... they beep, they buzz, they play stupid songs and they provide little educational value.  This great instrument set will provide kids with the noise-making that they crave, but with the educational value of actually making the noise on real instruments!Parents, too, will have a hard time resisting the allure of these super-fun instruments.  Your kids will be dingin' away on the triangle while you shake your thing with the maracas.... it'll provide interactive and fun play for years!  Get some good CDs to accompany this set, while you're at it.  A fun African CD (like Amadou and Mariam's Dimanche a Bamako) will do the trick nicely, as most of these instruments are rhythm instruments that will fit in nicely with that highly rhythmic music. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My mom bought this for my son at 18 months and he LOVES it. The entire set is excellent quality and comes in a nice wooden crate (we use the crate for arts & crafts). My son is now a very accomplished Harmonica & flute player (he's now only 19 months) - he can't get enough of these instruments. One thing to look out for though -- the tip of the stick that you use for the xlyphone came off and I found my son eating it - it is definitely a choking hazard - I just took the stick away and tossed it in the garbage and he uses one of the other thick wooden sticks to play the xylophone and he hasn't missed a beat!****UPDATE**** 5/8/08It is now almost 3 years later and my son still plays with all of the instruments in this set. Looking back at all the toys we bought or he received as gifts, this is still one of his favorites and has helped foster his interest in music. I STILL highly recommend this set!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 3 year old daughter loves this!  The instruments are unique for a kid's set. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Just okay - purchased for my 3 and 1 year old; they like it.  The kazoo didn't work and the xylophone had a few keys that had no tone at all. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I think this is a great set of musical instruments, and I love the box they come in.  But I think the xylophone is not worth it; we have a very nice glockenspiel at home that is on key and has a much nicer sound.  All-in-all it is a very nice set with a variety on wooden instruments.  Wood is so much nicer than plastic, because then you don't have to worry about BPA or anything like that. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I had several issues with this toy and wish I hadn't bought it.  They are as follows, and these are the same problems many other people have had.  First of all, this toy was horribly made.  The jingle sticks in particular were rough on the handles.  Were these sanded down at all?  I seriously doubt they were.  I seriously feared splinters from them.  I mean, wood chips were all over in the box when we opened it.  I know this is a toy, but the point should still be to foster a love of music in kids that play with it.  That will not happen with these instruments.  It is impossible to make any kind of real music with these.  The xylophone is made of wood which is so soft that my child dented it the first day, and all the notes it plays sound the same.  The notes on the recorder are the same way.  They are just screeches with no distinction between the notes.  The rest of the instruments are just random wooden things meant for banging, so you really can't mess them up.  There are some good toy instruments out there, but I really wouldn't want someone to think they had found them with this toy.  This is definitely not worth even half as much as this costs. [SEP]"",""[CLS] On the upside the harmonica is excellent quality, my 2 year old loves playing it for his baby sisters. The shake things with the metal in them are nice, we walk around the house shaking them, dancing. The crate is really nice, we keep our melissa/doug pound and roll in it so the balls don't go all over the house.On the downside is my son doesn't really like the triangle, he can't figure out the (yellow/red) hand the clappity things, the long clapper (red/blue/green) doesn't impress him, the kazoo we thought was a whistle gets little use, the end of the flute came off and is no where to be found, we're not sure what the hallow piece of wood instrument is for. They xylophone is really monotone, it all sounds the same, one of the wooden knobs that holds the one of the red pieces on fell off so not that piece slides around.In conclusion, the set is cute, all solid wood, but gets little use. I'd recommend getting a metal xylophone instead. We bought a nice one on novanatural made of metal and wood for $20. Find a different kazoo, we have a metal one he loves, it was kind of nice having 2 of them because his friends could play too. Invest in a harmonica, this one or another.

B00021HB90,"[CLS] Several of my daughter's friends have rocking horses and I love ours the most! The horizontal slats across the bottom provide the perfect platform for little ones to stand on. I have had this horse for almost a year now, and have had no problems with it. My daughter and her friends loves riding this rocking horse. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My daughter (just made 2 earlier this month) has been whinnying around the house and trying to ride her stuffed horse, Maximus, to no avail...and then this package arrived!!  Putting it together took about 15 min., due to the fact that you have to maneuver the legs of the horse into the correct position to have them screw into the correct holes.  The back legs are harder to position than the front, for some reason.  Our horse (now named, Moon by our daughter) didn't have any smell as noted in another review, and the boards in the platform/rocking part didn't have any knots in them, and weren't sharp at all (like the other review noted).  I did notice that the ear that makes the whinnying/galloping noises was difficult for her to find the button on...it's such a small button -- I would like it to be the entire ear, or at least a larger button to push, esp. for a 2 year old.  My child isn't able to get on it by herself (yet) but is able to step up on the platform to ask to get put on it.  The horse itself is plush and soft.  It's mane and tail are little wiry, though...but the difference in texture is nice, it looks like a real horse!  The vinyl saddle doesn't seem very durable -- it's thin, really, more like a band-aid in that it just wraps around the horse body -- but I don't expect her to want to ride this when she's 5, so it'll last until then.  I like that it seems easy to clean...we had some juice fed to Moon, and I was able to wipe the juice beading on his muzzle. [SEP]"",""[CLS] One reviewer mentioned that the legs are too narrow for the pre-drilled holes. It was true with ours, and after the front legs were loosely secured I needed to stretch, i.e. gently yet forcefully pull, the rear legs back to line up with the pre-drilled holes. The internal skeleton feels quite sturdy by also has some give to allow this to bend as needed. Overall, an issue to be aware of but not overly concerned about.I'd recommend a drop or two of blue (medium strength) LocTite for the bolts. I just know they're going to loosen up with all the rocking our horse gets, and I don't want to overly tighten the bolts since they're being tightened against relatively soft wood.The four planks that make up the platform under the hose are great. My 20 month old can safely and confidently stand on these while he mounts and dismounts. In fact, mommy and daddy have stood on these and fake sat on the horse during the all-important break in and familiarization period. :) I noticed that other rocking horses are lacking a similar platform on which to stand.I also like that the body of this toy is fairly narrow, so it's easy for a little guy to sit on and isn't going to encourage the kids to grow bow legged like our cartoon cowboy heros.Lastly, this was yet another toy that my son was tears-streaming-screaming-fit-terrified-of when it first emerged from the box (despite that he was crawling all over the box before I opened it). He had his worst night of sleep yet after laying eyes on it -- nightmares, I'm presuming. So we left it to sit in the corner of the room, pointed out cowboys on horses in his books and in toy catalogs, and gave it a pat every time we walked by it, and often referred to it from a safe distance. After about three days, he warmed up to it, petted it, and finally threw a leg over it. Now he's a regular rodeo rider. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We gave this to our 16 month old son for Christmas.  HE LOVES IT!  This rocking horse is WELL crafted and beautiful!  I'm so impressed! You can tell that it will last through many children.  The look on my son's face when he saw his horse under the tree was priceless.It was a little hard to put together.  I thought I would give it a shoot and impress my hubby... not so much.  He had no problem, but it was tricky to get the horse to line up on the base and put the screw in.  You also have to stretch the horses back legs.  BUT, once put together - it's well worth it!I love how the base is wood and not yucky plastic.  Another job well done by Melissa and Doug! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 16 month old boy loves this horse.  He unwrapped it christmas morning and was just stood there touching its nose and its ear.  It took ages to get his other presents opened as he kept going back to this one.  It is lovely quality.....really easy to put together in a short time.  My only complaint would be that the sides of the straight pieces of wood that affix under the horse are actually very sharp...my teenager caught his ankle on an edge and had an inch long gouge in his skin.  Really they just needed to be rounded off.  It rocks nicely and I am very pleased with it and so is my little guy.  Highly recommended, but adults mind your ankles.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] Stars as follows: +1 as advertised (mostly), +1 made with precision, +2 no batteries,  +1 fascinating, -1 overpriced (but, I knew that when I bought it, so, I will take the minus back).With the mirror on a hard level surface, the disk will run for 3 minutes.The ad says, Disk will spin faster and louder the longer it goes. If true, these people will be awarded a Pulitzer Prize in science as they  have invented a perpetual motion machine. Alas, the laws of physics says no.What they are calling spin is actually wobble. Spin, as most commonly understood, would be a bicycle wheel set in motion, turning on a centered axis. The Euler disk is set on its edge and put into motion with a twist of the wrist. It does spin on edge, but, only briefly before friction begins to make war on energy and the spin begins to degrade (from about 50 rpm to 0. A decrease in spin rate induces wobble(one side up, the other side down). It is interesting that the further spin decreases, the more wobble increases - from 0 to a very high rate (accounting for the volume increase). I have no way to measure it, I would guess 400 cycles per second??.  Thus, the disk appears to spin up increasing in speed. Saying, the disk spins faster adds a little mystery to the device which certainly helps sales. It wobbles faster, just doesn't have the same appeal.The same effect can be demonstrated with a plate - please, not grandmothers Limoge, maybe Melmac. Set it on edge on a wood floor and give it a spin. Lotsa fun and makes lotsa racket!The best educational effect of this product would be to look up Leonhard Euler - a truly amazing mind. Or, work out the mathematics that the disk demonstrates.This is a gadget that is better left on the counter for guests to play with than as a gift. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is fascinating.

Kids LOVE this stuff, and it has some awesome qualities that IMO outweigh the negatives. It has it's limits and is unique. Very lightweight and foam-like it does not dry hard but retains a little give. It can be fragile, and not good for thin designs (arms WILL break off unless handled very carefully). Kids instinctively seem to LIKE to break up dried projects which kind of crumble in a satisfying way. So watch out for that. It is very soft, and will slump easily, so is not good for sculptures that challenge gravity, unless you use an armature of some kind. However, it does shrink a bit when it dries, and is prone to crack when an armature is used. It is really good for any project that requires simple, solid and lightweight objects. It is VERY easy and satisfying to manipulate- squishy and pliable without much effort, and is NOT sticky and leaves NO residue. A great choice for kiddos with sensory issues. Also great for parents and teachers who cannot have anything messy in their rooms- I used to bring this along to teach after school art classes where they'd stick me in all kinds of bizarre rooms- no sinks, rugs, libraries, fussy teachers who'd give me dirty looks as I set up, etc- no problem! My favorite thing to use this for is as a color mixing lesson. In the assortment you get the primary colors plus white, and so can make any and all colors. I guide the kids by asking them to take little pieces of specific colors and blending them by twisting, pulling, folding and squishing until they are blended and new colors appear. Young children are amazed at the magical way the colors swirl together and then transform! DO NOT let them just openly start mixing whole pieces of colors without guidance- they WILL end up with a large ugly ball of mauve/brown, which they WILL discover will bounce when they throw it down on the floor firmly, and WILL proceed to bounce it around the room as it gathers all the dirt and germs from the day. Trust me. Only let them take little pieces at a time, and work through the rainbow as a group, having them form neat little balls when they are finished and they will end up with a lovely assortment of colors which they can then use to make one or more small sculptures. Adding more or less of some colors to achieve endless shades. Encourage them to make simple shaped sculptures so they don't get frustrated- remember nothing too thin or gravity defying. You have to know the limits of the material. This color mixing lesson will slow down the process for them, and strengthen their hands and get to know the material as they go. It takes an otherwise short lived project and stretches it out to a 30-40 minute color mixing and sculpture lesson. Have fun! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My child has Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) and is easily overwhelmed by lights, sounds and other stimuli (which is impossible to avoid when out in public).  I purchased these so that I can always keep one in my purse in case he needs something to calm him down.  This is a large box of model magic, but the individual packages are the perfect size to carry in my purse - a bit smaller than the ones you get in a regular pack of model magic.  I think these would make great party bag favors and class prizes as well.  Plus, since it is Model Magic, it is basically scent free and does not stick to stuff or make a mess. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Safe and easy to use. Individual packets allow for using just as much as you would like to give [SEP]"",""[CLS] Purchased this at the beginning of summer for my 6 year old. She loves it, and the huge box it came in. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Model magic is one of the funnest modeling compounds for kids, but it can be problematic because it does not keep well once the package has been opened. This class pack with several small packages is a great solution - the price is better than if you buy their smaller packs, it keeps pretty much indefinitely unopened, and you can open just a little at a time for your child. My kids and their friends love using this together with googley eyes (which will stick to the clay) to make all sorts of little creatures! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My kids love model magic,  great for all those school projects.  Easy to paint once dry.  You can also mix colors (with a lot of kneading) to make secondary colors.  And in the classpack it comes in nice small foil pouches so less is wasted.  It stays moist for at least 2 years in the pouch (that is how long our last box lasted).  Once modeled, it dries in 24-48 hours to a very lightweight and sort of foamlike consistency.  It does NOT have a shiny surface when dry.Each 1 oz packet when rolled into a sphere about 2 inches in diameter.  I uploaded a photo of one packet worth with a ruler and a soda can so you can see what volume it takes up.  Since the stuff is quite light, it is fairly large.However, when ordering from Gamingect the pouches came all mixed together in a regular cardboard box.  This does not bother me much, as I already had the box pictured (with the lift up flap lid) from my previous order. That box had nice dividers in it for the 4 colors so you could see at a glance how much of each was left.  It may be that this is how the product is shipped now.  I preferred the old box that is pictured in the photo.  I did not deduct any stars, since the box is not the product itself. [SEP]"",""[CLS] They (11, 9, 6) love, love LOVE model magic.  It is supple, very lightweight and easy to work with, and they create little animals for their block and lego buildings, or flowers and other art projects for me to display, or tiny little game pieces for board games they make up, and so on.  This price is such a bargain, it will keep your kids entertained for months.My husband likes this stuff much more than playdoh, because it doesn't smell and doesn't crumble into little pieces and get ground into the rug.  It does harden pretty quickly if left out, so a single bag may not have as many repeated uses as playdoh, but honestly, playdoh gets pretty gross after a few sessions anyway.  With these very affordable 1 oz bags, you can just open another one when the first one dries.Highly recommend this for any child who is beyond putting toys and inedible objects into their mouth.

Putting them in is sort of tricky, so I do it for my kids now so no more get ruined.I still think this is a wonderful toy though because it teaches color matching.  It also gives kids a chance to use their imaginations and be creative, so it's a toy I would recommend. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I had really high hopes for this one and was delighted when my sister selected this as a birthday gift for my son.My little boy is 26 mos old and generally prefers puzzles and blocks as toys.  He doesn't care much for cars/trucks.  So I thought this toy with lots of manipulatives would be super fun for him.What I discovered, sadly, is that although he is happy when you present this toy to him, he is not long entertained by it.  There is a plastic frame with holes for the buttons/pegs to fit into, and the picture cards slide into notches on the backside.  Think Lite Brite.The unfortunate thing is that even if you fit the buttons into the holes properly to complete a picture of a dragon/house/etc, the mosaic that results really looks nothing like a dragon/house/etc.  You just have a blob of buttons/pegs.Also, the pictures are confusing.  Once you insert one of the picture cards into the plastic template frame, you're not sure what to do for lots of the holes.  Many of the holes are half green, half white.  Do we put a green peg in here?  Or leave it empty? Whichever you choose there is a big outcome on the final product.My boy does enjoy the mechanical activity of insertion/removal but that's about it.  This is a textbook three-star toy.EDIT:  AUGUST 23 2011.  In the past few months, my son's interest has ratcheted up a lot with this toy.  It's an ideal last-half-hour-before-bed toy as we're winding down in the living room getting ready for sleep.  He's much more interested in putting the right color peg in the right color hole and is proud when he has completed the picture.  I still think the quality isn't great but the boy likes it.EDIT:  JULY 22, 2012.  Still some decent interest in this!  It almost has a calming effect because he's so comfortable with it but it's still just fun enough that he asks to play with it maybe 2 nights a week.EDIT: DECEMBER 8, 2014. Would you BELIEVE he still loves this at almost 6 years old? We lost it for six or eight months, but then when we found it again, it was like he was reunited with an old friend. It's obviously way too easy for him, but so comforting and he LOVES the smooth feeling of the pegs once a bunch of them are inserted into the frame.EDIT AUGUST 2017:  Although my son, who is now 8 1/2, rarely plays with this, he still sometimes requests it out of a burst of sentimentalism.  I recently mentioned I was sending a copy of it to a 3 yr old cousin, and my son mistakenly understood me to say that I was sending our own copy of this toy to the cousin.  He completely freaked out at the thought of giving up this toy.  It's a visceral favorite.A++ [SEP]","[CLS] Start by placing the illustrated pattern cards under the transparent board as a guide, then move on to creating their own unique designs! The child has to figure out which color is displayed in the picture and then find the matching peg color to fit it in the picture. Play with the lid flat or use the triangular stands to hold the board up at an angle. The board also functions as a lid for the practical carry-case where all pieces can be stored after playing, making it simple to take on the go with you.

B0002OH0YS,"[CLS] Very well made toy and easy for my 14 month old grandson to work - he learned how to put the balls in the top holes and push them down the first day.  He doesn't get the stopper, yet, so my son disassembled the toy and removed it; he'll replace it when Jaden gets older! The balls have fun designs instead of being plain colors which make them more visually exciting to watch!  Great learning toy! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I was disappointed by this toy based on the reviews.  I bought it for my son's first birthday.  My main complaint is that I don't understand the purpose of the lock on the side; why did they even put it there?  It seems to always get in the way, and I am constantly adjusting it to keep the balls flowing freely.  It is very hard to explain the mechanism in a review, but it is annoying.  It is not a simple open/close knob; it rotates a beveled tip, and that beveled tip needs to be at just the right angle to continuously let balls flow freely.  My son can't figure out how to rotate the knob on his own yet to let the balls through, so he gets frustrated and leaves the toy.  Also, if my son pushes down the ball furthest from the lock first, and there is another ball sitting in a different ball holder area up top, it gets stuck.  It cannot flow past the bottom of the ball sitting up top, and my 12-month-old can't figure out how to resolve that on his own.  So the flow of his play gets interrupted.  It cost almost $30, so I expected a lot more for my money.  In my opinion, the company needs to get rid of the lock on the side and also make the gap between the first ramp and the top of the toy larger so that balls don't get stuck on each other.

B0002Q2O9C,"[CLS] Loads of fun...entertaining for sure! [SEP]"",""[CLS] (I received this item as a gift in exchange for an honest review)I chose this for my children as a craft project to do at home.  I am always aware with things like this that I should do it FIRST, before they get all excited about it, just in case it doesn't work as shown.It works fine, but I wouldn't necessarily say it's over the top great.  My main issue is the weight of the main unit.  If you make things cheaply, then when you ask kids to use it you aren't always going to have a very satisfied kid.  It's frustrating for the unit to be moving around so much.I would definitely recommend covering up your table while doing this, or better yet, doing it in summer outside. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 7 year old had a blast playing with this!  Once I showed her how it works, she could do it independently and did so, making pictures for all her friends, until the batteries ran out--on the first afternoon!  Our kitchen also ended up covered in glitter, but that's another story.What you do is hook the paper onto the spinner, turn on the machine, and the paper spins rapidly, then you squeeze paint onto the paper.  It swirls and splatters, making fun designs.  There is a plastic splash guard that keeps the paint pretty well contained.  But be sure to use it, or you will have a mess!My daughter thinks the spinner is great and that her pictures are fantastic.  Unfortunately it will be an occasional toy because I'm not willing to replace the battery every day. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My kids had a bit of fun with this.  This splash guard mostly containded the mess, which is good.It was kind of difficult for my kids (6 and 8) to squeeze out only a few drops at a time so a fair amount of the paint ended up spinning right off the paper and wasted in the tray.  But there was still plenty of paint to fill the cards that it came with.  It came with some white papers and some black.  This seemed like a good idea.  The colors barely showed up on the black paper though and even the white ones where not nearly as bright as in the picture. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Nice basic art spinner.  I almost threw out the splash guard.  It was so flimsy, one could even compare it to the type of plastic that is around the mouth of some mayo/dressing-type mason jars. I was grateful to see the label, which reads:Splash guard, do not discard just as I was about to throw away (had a rip from opening the box).The box states that 5 colors of paint are included. These colors are: blue, pink, yellow, green and purple.It is a bummer that this paint isn't washable.  It would have been nice to just leave my responsible daughter in the kitchen, playing happily. However, we did not want to take the chance without throwaway clothes. She managed to keep her clothes clean, but accidentally touched the couch before thoroughly washing her hands-ugh!I appreciated that this machine was simple to use with no problems adding my own paint, glitter (needed more) and card stock (cut w/ a guillotine paper cutter).This is very lightweight product, so it can be easily broken by misuse/heavy hands.  The upside of this fact: This only takes 1 C battery. The light weight of the product does not seem to affect functionality.  It does what it says it will do-no problems here.I LOVE that the center spinner easily pops out to clean the base.  I used a damp paper towel to just wipe off the paint.  Unfortunately, the paint didn't readily come off the actual spinner the same way. Oh, well.Regardless, my daughter and I had fun making memories... [SEP]"",""[CLS] I had something like this as a kid.. I remember hours of making priceless art for my parents, splashing paint all over the kitchen table. And then I remember putting it in the back of the closet and forgetting all about it.So, when this came up for review, I chose it for nostalgic reasons really. I wanted to see if my daughter did the same thing as I did. Loved it for one day, and then quickly forgot about it. But actually, my daughter played with it for a good week or two, until she ran out of paper. Now, they do sell refills.. but I found them to be pricey so we just cut our own.  The same with the paints. It doesn't come with much, but the refills are pricey. I suggest refilling the bottles with your own.Its a great rainy day toy.. but there is only so much you can do with it. The paper spins, you squeeze paint onto it. That's pretty much the gist of it. A nice toy to bring out on a sick day, or quiet night, but don't expect it to be your kids favorite toy ever. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We received this toy tonight and my youngest daughter (5 years old) used all the paint making some really cool spin art for me.  Overall, I think it is a wonderful activity for children that was surprisingly NOT messy.  Of course, the splash guard  that is included looks A LOT like trash (luckily they have a small sticker that tells you it is the splash guard and not to be thrown away).It takes one C battery which we had on hand (luckily) and we were good to go.  My daughter had a blast and once I showed her where to place the corners she had no problem doing it all on her own.  The paper is like (black and white)card stock and even though it curls a bit at first after getting painted but eventually it lays down flat. We used both colors but only the white color works nicely.  The black doesn't show the colors good and after the paint dries you can't hardly see it so do yourself a favor and use the white side.  The only other problem I see is that the glitter tubes should have a shaker end since younger kids have real problems shaking anything out of an open tube.I have a feeling we will be going get more paint (and paper) really soon because it was a hit with my daughters and we taped their art work to the computer cabinet. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a great Spin Art. My 3 year old likes it and is fully capable of using it with supervision. Not sure why the rating is 6 and up. If you liked Spin Art as a kid this will bring back great memories. The colors this model comes with are fluorescent. While it comes with a good amount of paint the paper amount was a little on the light side. Plus, the black paper it comes with looks really great with the colors while wet. When it dries that colors fade and the painting look awful. I suggest sticking with the white paper.If this came with more paper and the black worked better it would easily be 5 stars, but I have to drop it a star because of those problems.The unit is very light weight and compact.Any kid will like it.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] Game is ok. Takes a bit to set up. A couple things I wish they added were two sets of quick ref cards. Since it is a two player game. I found the game fun however I am some what torn as to if it is fun enough to get all the expansions and go all out with this game. I love axis and allies however this is a different format than that game. I would recommend it to anyone that likes WW2 board games with strategy involved. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Memoir 44 is a great game that is easy to pick up.This is a small issue, but I will state that the interior of the box is cramped and difficult to put things back.  I know that may seem silly to some, but to game players it is an issue.Memoir is yet another example from Day Of Wonder how smart people make fun games that speak to adults and children alike. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Apparently this game and more like it is the in thing now! My grandson was so happy to get it that he has agreed to mow the yard for me for the rest of the summer :) [SEP]"",""[CLS] The upsides to this game: it is easier to teach to new players, it is faster to play than most war games, and it is random and fun. The downsides: there are not nearly as many options in this game (attacking, defending, strategy), the strategy itself is limited and depends on luck a lot, and the number of scenarios leaves the player wishing for an expansion very soon after they get their game. I like this game a lot and I have been able to enjoy it with people who I wouldn't typically play war games with, but I also like more from my war games most of the time. I want more strategy, more thought, more time, more pre-planning, more units, more choices, more everything! But I like it, and if you aren't a hardcore war gamer than you will probably like it too! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Memoir '44 fits into the war games genre of board games.  The game pits the Allied forces against Germany in a series of battles that take place in France during 1944.  Each scenario includes an historical background of the battle at hand, instructions on how to set up the board, and the victory conditions.  The double-sided board accommodates battles on the beach and in the French countryside.  Terrain tiles are used to recreate the scene - forests, hills, hedgerows, towns, rivers, bridges, and bunkers all offer strategic advantages in battle.  Both sides are allocated a certain number of infantry, artillery, and armor (tanks) in each battle.  Each type of unit has its advantages and disadvantages, and players must decide when and where to move these units.  Moving units around the board is not a free-for-all.  Players are limited by the actions available on command cards in their hands.  While eliminating enemy units is the most common way to achieve victory, players can also win by accomplishing strategic objectives such as liberating towns or securing bridges.The best way to play Memoir '44 is to play as one side, then reset the board and play as the other side.  You can set up the board and play both sides in about 90 minutes.  The base game is designed for two players but can be played with more.  With a second copy or a special expansion, up to eight players can take part in epic battles called Overlord scenarios.  Additional expansions allow you to fight in eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Pacific.  While the base game comes with 16 battle scenarios, additional scenarios are included with each expansion and in a hardcover campaign book.  Plus, the Memoir '44 web site has hundreds of free user-created scenarios.I haven't played Memoir '44 as much as some other games in my collection, but it's easily my favorite war game (and I've played many games of Risk and Axis & Allies). [SEP]"",""[CLS] My wife and I find, by and large, that most of Days of Wonder's games are pretty fantastic. They make quality games with quality components. Their art and design are impeccable. Seriously. Just take a look at Pirate's Cove, Small World, Mystery of the Abbey, Ticket to Ride... these are all beautiful games. Whether or not you like a given one will, of course, depend upon your taste, but I believe any gamer would be hard-pressed to say there wasn't at least one of their games that they just love. Case in point: Memoir '44.Memoir '44 is solid. Opening the box, a lot of you my age will probably be hit with a little nostalgia to see lots of little green army men (or blue, for the Germans). The basic set includes Infantry, Tanks and Artillery for each side, plus battlefield accessories like sandbags, hedgehogs and bridges. And terrain tiles. Loads of terrain tiles. Hills, forests, hedgerows, rivers... stacks and stacks of hexes to recreate whatever terrain you want. The sheer number of components are impressive, in and of themselves.Memoir '44 was made by Richard Borg and uses his Command & Colors system. Each player has a hand of command cards, most of which designate a a third of the board (left flank, center, right flank) and a type or number of units. When units attack, special dice are rolled to determine the outcome. If you roll the unit type or a wild, you destroy a model in the unit. Other Command & Color games' dice will be a little different, but in Memoir their six sides are Soldier (x2), Tank, Grenade (wild), Retreat and Star (special). Destroying the last model in a unit garners a victory point, and most basic scenarios end when a victory point total is reached. It is a simple system that is easily accessible, resolves quickly and keeps the game moving.The game comes with some premade scenarios that are designed to emulate battles of World War II. And this is where it breaks with a lot of board games... the sides are not necessarily evenly matched. I like this, actually... it provides perspective on warfare. None of them are so unbalanced that they are not fun, though. I personally love the historical background on them, and it engages you to try to succeed where your side actually failed, or to try to get history to repeat. There's a lot to learn from this game, and it is no small wonder that this is used in some classrooms to teach the history of WWII.The game itself is very expandable, as well. My wife and I picked up several of these. There's the Eastern Front, the Mediterranean Theater, the Pacific Theater, the Air Pack, terrain boards, scenarios... I don't think that there are many WWII battles that you absolutely could not approximate with this games. Additionally, there's the Campaign Book, a great supplement that has a couple players play a series of battles, with prior battles influencing future ones. Mostly, that involves troop setup. But sometimes, one side winning or losing a battle will trigger a different next battle. Angie and I played through two different campaigns and had a great time; this is one of our favorite games.When my wife told me about this game, I was originally a little meh about it; more than a little Axis & Allies baggage, likely. I wasn't sure that I would like what would for sure be a extremely long game. But from the first game, we absolutely loved this. I cannot count how many hours we have spent playing this since picking it up shortly after its 2004 release. Oddly enough, my wife likely could. This stands out as the only game she has logged every play of (on the Days of Wonder website). And the play time (usually about an hour) allowed us to quickly switch sides and play out the same scenarios again. Yes, we like it that much. I can remember now how we were so excited that the Air Pack was coming out that we called quite a few stores around the state before locating one an hour away to pick this up at. It's just that excellent.My verdict on this game is that it is a perfect fusion of a wargame and a boardgame. Borg's Command & Colors system is simple and elegant, allowing turns to progress without bogging down. I love it, my wife loves it. This is a game I am looking forward to introducing my daughter to, as well. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I'm not a wargamer, partly because I never got the opportunity.  I might have been when I was teenager, because I was enthralled with learning about the military and playing military style computer games along with other types of games.  I was however never big into playing with plastic army men.  Seems like plastic army men were begging for a game to be made for them and Memoir '44 does that very well.  I've heard about how long most wargames take (3,4,5,6,..10+ hrs), and at this stage of my life with job, kids, and church, I don't have the time to play. Memoir '44 really fits that niche for me with the kind of wargame that I am looking for, because it can easily be played in about an hour.  The base game provides plenty of replay value and challenge as each person can try their hand playing each side.Some people complain about too much luck, and I understand that isn't to some people's tastes.  I however enjoy the luck factor, because it adds uncertainty that happens in real life.  This leads to some neat heroics where the last infantry takes out that tank and causes cheers and groans on either side. Again, the whole point of good luck based games is to give you options to minimize your opponents luck factor and maximize yours.  Memoir '44 does this very well by the use of terrain which is expected in a tactical style wargame.  Effective use of terrain will help you win the game.The command cards are a nice way to simulate the ebb and flow of the overall battle.  The cards add some nice offensive power to the game that simulates some possible real life situations that happen on the battlefield.  Cards such as Their Finest Hour that represents those moments when troops rally to the cause and Behind Enemy Lines where a squad is able to penetrate deep behind the enemy to wreck some havoc.Memoir '44 does have educational value by recreating famous battles of WWII.  Each mission provides some history from the war.  It also gives me as a father time to explain to my children what WWII was about, so they will one day learn the amazing sacrifice out country paid for our freedom.One thing the base game lacks is the variety of air planes, campaigns, and other forces to really recreate some interesting battles.  However, that's where the expansions come into play, and maybe one day I'll be able to purchase more as my pocket book allows.All in all, I truly enjoy fun factor that Memoir '44 provides, and so does my 7yr old daughter and 5 yr old son. [SEP]","[CLS] Memoir '44 is a unique historical game from Days of Wonder where players command a horde of little plastic Army men facing-off in dozens of WWII battles on an oversize hex game board. Each battle scenario mimics the historical terrain, troop placements and objectives of each army. Deploying forces through a variety of Command cards, the smart commander uses the unique skills of his units to their greatest strength. Easy to learn and fast-paced, Memoir '44 requites strategic card play, timely dice rolling and an aggressive, yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory. There are 17 unique historical scenarios, including a monster-size double-board version of Omaha Beach. The game has a double-sided, three section board map of the battlefield, featuring beach landings and countryside terrain. There are 44 lavishly painted double-sided terrain hexes, along with the 3D miniatures and obstacles to go on them. Also included are 60 Command cards, including 20 WWII Tactics cards and 40 troop movement Section cards, and two Army bags of incredibly detailed miniatures.

The cradle was relatively easy to put together but the only issue is that it seems the bottom is slightly too narrow for the slide slots on the sides, meaning the bottom can fall out if you don't slide it through the slots and hold it tight against you while screwing in the screws; I had to take it apart and redo that part, holding it tight. It is beautiful, especially with the cutouts on the sides and scalloped edges. It's heavy and sturdy and high quality as it's stood up to my daughter's rough play.

The only things that I think could be improved about this is that: 1) the volume can be a little wonky.  You have to set the volume up very high, like over 20, to really hear it.  The lower volume numbers are ridiculously low.  Also, the microphone seems to have MUCH a louder volume as compared to the music no matter what. 2) The microphone coil is pretty short (which might make sense for safety reasons, but it is not unusual to hear that screeching noise due to microphone interference. Obviously, I would prefer microphone interference to a strangulation hazard, but if they can't make the coil longer, then I think they need to address the microphone interference. 3) while I really like the hold function which prevents the child from constantly rewinding, fast forwarding, stopping, etc. while the music is playing, it has a drawback, which is that the child CAN open the cd player while the hold button is on. So if they are very determined like my daughter, they can succeed in playing with the buttons to make it do something other than play music, such as insert, remove cd player, stick your finger in when cd is spinning. Frankly, I think the open and close feature should be disabled while a cd is playing. Now, these are just helpful suggestions if the maker was interested in improvement, but I am actually really happy all in all with the CD player.  Seems like I got lucky because it's been 6 months and it keeps working. Also, shop around for this, because the prices are highly variable.UPDATE: This product is still going strong 10 months later.  I would say that the microphone interference can be annoying particularly because you can actually have the microphones turned off and still get a tiny bit of static/interference.  Again, not hugely annoying but still weird. Looking into other CD players with microphone for kids, it seems like this is a problem across the board with some microphones that actually stop working.The other thing that is great is that my daugther is not yet 3 obviously cannot read yet, but because the CD players had distinctly shaped buttons (some are squares, triangles, octagon/hexagon, circles, etc.) she is able to memorize that the triangle is for playing and the square for stopping, the smaller up and down triangles for volume control, etc. I think this is advantageous for a smaller group of kids than a CD players with all circular button let's say.

We added this set to our saxoflute also by Quercetti and compatible.  Now our children can build fun creations musical and not.  My daughters use these to make bracelets and many more cool stuff.  Definitely worth the money and none of my daughters' friends have these so they are a hit when they come over as well. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is our 2nd set.  All kids love these.

Better then blocks because older kids 7 and 9 come over and play with these all the time too.  Great purchase, highly recommend [SEP]"",""[CLS] A great creative play set. My son still plays with them [SEP]"",""[CLS] My son is three years old and he likes playing with lego duplos and mega bloks  a lot. I came across these toys while surfing in the internet, and it looked a pretty innovative design so based on the good reviews I purchased it. They are, for sure, not substitute for legos but make a good addition to the collection.They are made from good quality plastic and have no sharp edges. Besides, I think they are big enough not to get swallowed. Parts attach pretty well. (not too stiff- kids can easily attach and detach; and not too loose so it does not fell off) and the colors are vibrant.With all articulations and different connector pieces, you can generate endless 3D images and my son, so far, went past my expectations. I believe they help with his development apart from being just fun.Although I like it, I have a couple of complaints too...Firstly, I think it is overpriced. 40 pieces for $24 makes a piece more than half a dollar. For the same price you can buy a 160 piece mega bloks with its storage bag (and pieces are way bigger too)&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Mega-Bloks-First-Builders-Deluxe-Building-Bag-160-Piece/dp/B0088LNF0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Mega Bloks First Builders Deluxe Building Bag 160-Piece</a>.Secondly, I think it should be sold more than 40 piece a bag. 40 is not enough to generate large tubal networks and that limits the fun.Finally, although it is compatible with another quercetti product&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Quercetti-Saxoflute/dp/B000FIZ8YA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Quercetti Saxoflute</a>&nbsp;it is pretty limited to what it is.

A couple of the red straight peces show lighter colored stress marks from my son repeatedly karate chopping long bars of them connected together but we've never had a piece break. He has played with these every single night for 2 years and counting and hasn't grown tired of them yet. His spacial intelligence and math testing results for school placement are at the top of the chart and I know its in part to dimensional building toys like this.

B0002YDQBY,"[CLS] This is the first maze bank I've ever purchased. I've thought about getting one before but have never done it. I think my boys ages 9 & 10 will enjoy getting these for Christmas this year with something in it. I'm actually thinking about putting movie tickets in it.I like the colorful box it came in. Save the box! It has step by step diagram instructions on one side. It took me a few minutes messing with it just to figure out how to initially open it. I removed the fake money in it and then replaced the top. Now I will have to complete the maze in order to get it to open again. So if you are wanting to put something inside of it bigger than the money slot, I advise you to do that right away before the marble gets on the other side of the lock and you have to figure out the maze for yourself.I purchased one of these already and am planning on getting another one.

Maybe if it isn't broken, it would be a fun little gift, but damage durring transit seems to be common, so it's a gamble.I'd steer clear.  There are better puzzle box gifts available. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I have been intrigued by puzzles of all sorts ever since a young lad over 60 years ago. Since that time I have found many and have several hundred in my collection. I enjoy hand held mechical puzzles ,into which I place this one. I also love puzzle books of all kinds. One of my favourite are mazes. What this puzzle does is combine mazes with a hand held box which is to be opened. There is no tricky secret to this puzzle,as is often the case. All it takes is a bit of patience,and since it is constructed of clear plastic,you can see the ball at all times and clearly see the places where the path to success is blocked. I will tell you one thing; that it took me a little time to realize that is that there is one little step that you must navigate to succeed. A couple of reviewers have critized the puzzle as being too fragile and susceptable to breaking. That may be so,but after all,it is made of plastic and if handled carefully should stand lots of use if used sensibily. Although ,if there is a gorilla nearby ,whose natural talent is the use of force;maybe you should warn him or keep it away from him. This puzzle can also fall into the category of a Puzzle Box ,and there are some real difficult ones .There are pins,balls,magnets and various moving parts that keep them from being opened and their secrets have to be found. Just imagine trying to solve this puzzle without being able to see the ball as well as all the inside barriers. For some further enjoyment or challenge ,after you get to be able to solve this puzzle easily;I suggest getting sone self adhesive labels and place a few on the outside of the cube,obscuring the maze channels somewhat;now you have increased the challenge. Hope you have as much fun with this puzzle as I am having. I often bring out puzzles and pass some around and everyone seems to enjoy them.

This is a bummer because you would think they'd make the saber part the typical separate plastic?

My son really loved it as it has a lovely combination of many forest animals and plants.

However, I still don't recommend this one for a child under 4 unless he or she has some expertise in dealing with puzzles.Finally, the cardboard  quality and the easiness of fitting the pieces are excellent as expected from Ravensburger (like I said you won't go wrong purchasing a puzzle from either of the vendors I mentioned above)I recommend this puzzle as long as the price is okay compared to the competitors.

B0006OHN7I,"[CLS] Well made toy, but if your kid has other cars and trucks and vehicles this might be kind of boring.  Very simple design (I would say good for a 1 year old maybe).  We didn't give the whole bucket as a gift at once...just a few pieces here and there.  We weren't even half way through the bucket and my son (almost 3) doesn't really play with them (and we started giving them out before he was 2).  It's a good first toy vehicle gift for a younger child, but not really something an older child would be into (my opinion at least). [SEP]"",""[CLS] Very durable products, but kids aren't interested in playing with it. Too bad.

My son has been playing with these for months (he's now 14 mo) and I'm glad I bought them despite what I considered to be a pretty steep price tag. These are definitely an investment as they are pretty indestructible, can go in the dishwasher, and hold up well to heavy toddler abuse. A great buy considering you get a lot in the bucket too!

What child doesn't enjoy cars, trains & airplanes!  As they grew they were able to start rolling them themselves/etc.One of my favorite things learned by this toy is hook & hole.  These vehicles click together by what we call pushing the hook into the hole.  The cars & trains have a hook on one end & a hole on the other - I will admit there are a couple that have holes on both ends & is confusing & frustrating, but I try to put those to the side.  There aren't many at all so really I shouldn't even bring it up.  They have to learn which ends are hooks & which ends are holes & then developmentally (note: this will take awhile, but is amazing to watch) learn to put the hook in the hole & push/click them together.  Yes, they will get frustrated b/c they want to be able to do it on their own, but when they do finally do it on their own it is very exciting!Also, these vehicles are the primary colors so it is a good tool to teach colors.  Vehicles are always fun in general.  These are easily washable in the sink.  And, we've had these for over a year & are still played with.  They aren't a toy that holds their attention very long, but they are cute & fun.  They are also good to put in the bath, but be sure to dry them off as the metal can rust.Overall, highly recommend.

B0006YXVKQ,"[CLS] O.K., I know that people are complaining about the fact that instead of finding out who committed murder one, you have to find out who ate a piece of cake at a certain time, with a certain beverage. These babyish details have not derailed the fun for either my daughter or me. As a matter of fact, I chose this version at a thrift store as opposed to another Clue, Jr. version (at the same thrift store) that seemed even more babyish due to dopey lookin' kids searching for a mutt (or something akin to that). The game does not seem too difficult, nor too simple. I think that this game could possibly be too above a five-year-old's head, but from sixish on would be great fun. After placing do-not-peek time and beverage bases in the center of the board in order to establish the crime scene, you place cardboard characters in the white time bases and furniture pieces in the yellow drink bases (including the crumb evidence base, which a character resides on). All these aforementioned pieces are placed in certain rooms on the board. Play begins by rolling the die: if you roll to the yellow side of the die, you can look under any piece of furniture; if you roll white, you may peek under any character. If you roll a number of spaces, you can move any character in a certain direction in order to get to the info you desire in order to win the game that much quicker. You can try to land on yellow footprints within a room in order to peek under the piece of furniture within that room, you can land on white footprints within a room to look under a character, or you can just try your best to go in an intended direction towards rooms and people that you have not checked out yet. It just adds a little more strategic action to the game, and a little more excitement. Of course, you must check off the times, drinks, rooms, and people that you have investigated in order to deduce who is the cake-snatcher. If the rules seem too confusing or complicated, just tweak them- fun is not always achieved by rules set in stone. Our pieces are not top heavy, and we do not really knock them over during gameplay. I do not feel that this game is cheaply made; it is just standard. Briarpatch or Ravensburger games seem no tougher than this game. I do not care that pencils were not included, as I have pencils in my home. My daughter and I have great fun figuring out the culprit, etc....we get to feel like Sherlock Holmes for a minute, just without a pipe or Scotland Yard detectives getting in the way. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We have quite a few board games at our house.  Clue Jr. is one that the kids (6 & 8) pick more frequently than the others.  You will need to play it with the kids several times until they get the hang of it.  After that, they will be able to play on their own.  However, it is a great way to sit down and spend time with your child too.This game is good for taking turns, working out strategies and following directions. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I loved Clue growing up, so when my mother asked me for gift ideas for my 8-year-old son, I suggested Clue Jr.Among other board games geared to his age, he received Clue Jr. as a Christmas present and was THRILLED. (He likes mysteries just like his Mom!) Unfortunately, our glee was short-lived.My brother's girlfriend, her 12-year-old son, my son, and I sat down to play this game. My brother's girlfriend read the instructions, and we tried to figure out what to do with the color coded stickers--and how to even BEGIN play. Now, let me just say that both of us are board game aficionados who played zillions of games of Clue in our day. I have a genius IQ and she's a pediatric nurse. In short, we ain't stupid.Yet, even mid-game, we had a hard time figuring out how to move the game pieces, how to discover clues to mark off the checklist, and so on. You see, each player does NOT have a specific game piece as in regular Clue. Instead, you peel off small stickers to place under the white bases (the green crumb label indicating the culprit and five time labels) and yellow drink labels to the five yellow bases.Then, you roll a color-coded die to determine if you should look under a yellow furniture pawn, under a white character pawn, or move ANY CHARACTER forward up to the number rolled on the dice. If a character lands on a yellow space, look at the bottom of the furniture piece that's in the room (for example, the plant on the patio). Then, secretly look under the furniture pawn that's next to that room.Even now, as I'm re-reading the instructions, I'm having a hard time understanding what to do! (So it doesn't make for easy reviewing, let alone playing!) Not only that, there's not a lot of room on the game board for putting furniture pieces BESIDE a room...let alone IN it!We were so frustrated and bored that all four of us agreed to quit--and play Pictionary Jr., instead.If you're feeling nostalgic and are tempted to buy Clue Jr. for a child, RESIST THE URGE. You'll be wasting your money and time in my opinion. (We're returning the game this weekend, in fact.) The pieces are chintzy, the game play is confusing, and it doesn't even come with pencils! [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is literally a dumbed-down version of the standard Clue game. Basically, one needs to determine which animal has taken which toy to the dog house (which stands next to the board.) Players take turns to toss the die, which determines how many steps to take. The characters in the game are the younger versions of the same characters in the regular Clue game: Mr. Green is Johnny Green (a cheerful kid). And these characters are cardboard cutouts that fit onto white plastic pieces (people movers). The bottom of the white pieces have different pictures on them (clues). But the characters themselves actually play no part in the game. There are several pieces of furniture (also cardboard cutouts) that fit onto white plastic pieces. Under these pieces are other clues. During the game, one must travel across the board (which does not take many steps) to check under each clue piece in order to determine which two pieces are missing.The good part is that one does not need to be able to read in order to play this game: the detective's note pad uses pictures instead. So if you know the dog is not missing, you can place a mark next to the picture of the dog.The bad parts, and there are many, include: the pieces are made top heavy, and they have to, due to the nature of the game, often occupy the same spot. But, there is little space on the board for pieces to occupy the same spot. As a result, they fall easily and reveal the hidden clues. This happens very often with young players (and this game IS made for the very young ones). The way this game is designed makes process of deduction appear rather haphazard.If you have a kid that can read--even if s/he is only a beginning reader, even if your kid can spell enough to figure out a word, I suggest you move right onto the standard Clue game. Yes, at the beginning, the standard game may be a bit hard to master. But it offers enough intrigue that most kids will grow to enjoy it.

B00073JTQQ,"[CLS] This is a very creative and educational game.  I love it, but my kids tried to play it once and have not asked to play it again, so I'm wondering how to get them into it again.  Part of the problem is that they found the rules confusing, and part of it is that they are not quite ready for it as far as their spelling skills are concerned.  I think they'll like this game a lot more in a year or so, so perhaps I jumped the gun a bit with my expectations.So, here's the deal.  Buy it and try it, and if the rules with the game don't work for you, make up your own game.  Gnood luck! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I teach first grade students that range in reading levels from Pre-K to upper second grade.  While reading books is an important part of our guided reading groups, I felt the need to add some variety to word work rather than using worksheets so I purchased some activities.In this game students see two letters using a machine that spits out the letters randomly.  Each card has 2 sides.  One side needs 1 letter; one side needs 2 letters.  (Thus far we've only used the 1 letter side.)  If a child can use one of the 2 letters he/she has to yell out the WORD!  I've had students grab the letter, yell out the letter, say the word wrong, etc...  However, that breaks the rules and the student doesn't get the letter.  :(  If the child does indeed make a word, the card is kept with the letter and the child gets a new card.  If letters aren't used they go back into the pile.It takes time learning how to play this game.  My strugglers obviously needed more support than my non-strugglers.  The goal is/was to help students make words and recognize words and this game does exactly that.  It also helps them to differentiate between vowels and consonants, a skill that needs a lot of work.I have another game by the same manufacturer that has a word selector but for some reason it doesnt work.  This one, however, works like a charm!  I move the top of it and out pops two letters!  There have been no issues so far.  I say this in case you have the other game (Bingo Sight Word) and have had issues. (Good News!  I received the new one and its working perfectly.  Way to go!)  Rather than flipping cards using the machines makes the game more exciting.I highly recommend this game for anybody, parent or teacher, who is looking for additional help in the area of word work.  It helps with sounds, letter recognition, 3-letter words and so much more.Not so short.  Sweet.  To the point. [SEP]"",""[CLS] There is a short window of time when this game would be fun.Beginning readers who are learning phonics would find it interesting.  For our children, this period is between ages 3 and 5.Kids know when games are supposed to be educational, the way they know that carrot cake and zucchini bread are ways of getting them to eat vegetables.  This game falls into that category.  It is helpful for adults to play with children, to help them sound out word possibilities.  It is not realistic for children of different reading abilities to play the game without one player being bored and another being frustrated.  Therefore, it is at best a game for one or two kids.  The novelty would be fun for kids who are still learning to sound out words---these kids may require a bit of help.  But the kids who don't need help would find the novelty to wear off quickly.The above is just our experience, and it may be different for other people.  We never enjoyed the game as a family enough to get it out frequently. [SEP]"",""[CLS] 5 year old in kindergarten really likes this game.  I adapt the rules a tad for him to play.  He can play with  his little friend but with me helping them.  It's fun for them but for the parent, when they're still very young and beginning readers, it should probably be thought of more as a sneaky way to get in reading practice.  All pieces are very durable, this game should last a very long time.  The cards are very thick cardboard, the rest is a very strong feeling plastic, no little edges or dangling pieces that might break off easier.  Only slightly annoying thing for me was the packaging.  This was packaged a little different than other ThinkFun games we've gotten.  First, be careful when pulling out of the annoying plastic twisty straps holding it into the cardboard.  The only piece not strapped is the top, the piece that holds the letters in.  So if you're not paying attention like I guess I wasn't it's pretty easy to flip it back a bit while trying to get the ties off and end up with the top falling off and little letter-tiles all over the floor.  The other minor annoyance is some of the other ThinkFun games we've got have a nice little pouch to hold everything in, then we just toss the box.  There is nothing but the box for this and it's way too big for the game pieces so stuff will end up moving around and coming apart and it's very likely I'll find a big mess of tiles and cards every time I open it up unless I use a ziplock or something to keep it all together.  Oh, one last thing I was a tad disappointed with is that the Zingo game has little slots so you can keep putting the tiles back into the feeder as you play, but this one doesn't have that so you need to open up the top to put them back in once  you're done with your game.Overall though, great game, well worth the money.  Durable and provides FUN education. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 5-year-old loves playing with letters and creating words which is why I bought this game for her. We have had fun with it, and I've actually made up different sets of rules to make the game more stimulating and interesting. Like some reviewers have mentioned, I wish the game had more 3 letter word possibilities which would make this more enjoyable and challenging. As it is, we've basically covered a lot of words and I can tell her interest has decreased a bit. We are currently working on four letter word combos and I wish Thinkfun would come up with a game with four-letter word combos. This is an excellent game overall, especially in motivating beginning readers, and depending on the level of your child's reading skills, I feel this can be introduced to children as young as 3 and up.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] This, like most ThinkFun games, is a solitary thinking game, but my kids really like it.  To play, you pick a card and set up the game pieces accordingly.  Your goal is to get your man from his starting location to the designated ending location.  He can walk along crates and tip them over to get to the next crate (the tipping is quite gratifying to the kids for some reason).  Once a crate is tipped over, you can't move it, although you may find yourself backtracking over it.  If you are stuck, the answers are printed on the back of each card. When you are finished, toss it into the handy storage bag until the next time you or your kids need an interesting diversion.It is not specifically an educational game, but it does provides practice in visualization, spatial skills, planning a few moves ahead, and thinking!I do wish there was an easy way to get replacement pieces.

We bring this on road trips because the kids can play in the car. All the pieces come in a convenient bag so you can throw it in a backpack or whatever. We leave it out on the table and anyone can grab a card and work on it. It's fun to see a kid figure out the puzzle before an adult. It's a specific kind of logical thinking that some are naturally better at than others. Those thinkers Iove it and the people that don't think that way naturally begin to start seeing how to think that way and feel really good about it.

The plastic is smooth with no craggy edges or sharp corners, shaped and weighted to make it all work as it should.  Actually, that is probably one of the best parts of playing this - to have the pieces set up, fall, and clink just right.

B00076OC60,"[CLS] We have an 18 year old Swing-n-Slide play set that included the Twin Towers and Pioneer swing set. Our set had a climbing net on one of the towers, but I took it out when we had small grandchildren and put solid boards over the opening. Now that they are older, I wanted to re-intall a climbing net on the tower. Unfortunately, this current model is NOT designed for that application. It is intended for use on either the PIONEER or WRANGLER play sets. So basically you have a cargo net the kids can climb up, then have to climb down again. So, I installed it on our Pioneer set, after I took down the two rings that were hanging in this location. Takes at least an hour to install. You will need to buy a 4x4 x8' board, that you cut down to 6' length. This board is mounted to two of the A frame legs on the Pioneer set. You will need a LONG 5/16 drill to drill through both 4x4 boards. You then attach this 4x4 using 5/16 carriage bolts and nuts provided with the kit. Using the same long drill bit, you will drill 3 holes on the top beam of the Pioneer set to allow you to install the upper end of the net (the fourth hole is provided by removing the bolt at the metal bracket that attaches the A frame to the top beam). Insert the 4 eyebolts through these holes, add the nuts and washers, and tighten with 1/2 deep well socket. Swing-n-Slide now provides plastic bolt covers, you simply use two wood screws/cover to install (need phillips head bit for your battery drill to install). To install the bottom net ends, you will need to drill four 3/8 holes in the 4x4 board you installed earlier. you then push the net rope ends through these holes. They provide 2 staples/rope to fasten the ropes to the board. You are supposed to pull the rope tight, thread it through both staples, hammer down the second staple, then pass the rope back through the first staple and hammer it down. IT IS BEST TO HAVE A HELPER FOR THIS STEP! very difficult to pull the rope tight enough while you are trying to hammer staples down.

B0007M2266,"[CLS] This is a review of the PS2 game.My husband and I are not big video game people.  We play one to three games a year, so we careful consider exactly what to purchase.  Lego Star Wars was a LOT of fun and one of our top 5 games ever played.Pros:-  It is two-player so we can play it as a couple and it has in fact helped us work on our communication skills because we have to work as a team.-  It is very fun to play because we can use the force!!! and build LEGO items!!! and its Star Wars!!!-  It is very silly and we often laugh out loud at the cut scenes which are tweaked a bit from the actual movie just for humor sake while still being true to the series.-  Very re-playable. In fact, we are currently replaying the game because it is so fun.-  The game is easy enough for kids yet enjoyable for adults.-  The diner area provides lots of studs (money) which helps you quickly buy items!-  Yes you can get 100% no matter what choices you make along the way, because you can always go back and get whatever you missed.-  Each level is short enough to complete each work night without interrupting with making dinner, chores, etc.  This works great in our busy lives with not a lot of free time.Cons:-  We get a little annoyed in battle scenes when we are constantly attacked, but once you purchase and turn on invincibility... the game is a lot more fun because you no longer die ever few seconds.  The battles in this game were more annoying than in the sequel.-  Every once in a while you will jump into a place that causes you to freeze, but we figured out that if the frozen character drops out of the level and your partner leaves that room and comes back in, the issue resolves itself and we can log back in and continue the game without having to do any refreshes or losing any progress.-  We found the flying levels a bit annoying because 1. you felt like you could not really control what was going on and ships were flipping around all the time... 2. in space its hard to tell what is what or which direction you need to head next.  Having invincibility and the ability to draw money to yourself made the flying levels more bearable, but they are not our favorite.In LEGO Star Wars, the pros outweigh the cons considerably.  It was one of the best games we ever purchased, though the sequel was better.  We expect to replay it quite a few times over the years. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Very cool!!  I like all of the episodes in this game.  All of the extras and the player option to drop in and out is fantastic.  What a great way to play with others.  The sound effects are just like the movie and including the soundtrack.  The lightsaber sounds are very cool.This is a great game for all those Star Wars fans.  Like us. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I like Lego Star Wars, and don't think the game is aimed toward children either.  My only complaint is that we're already beginning to get flooded with too many Lego Star Wars games and I'm not going to sit around and put up with it.  Actually, I can't do anything about it but complain.  Pick up ONE Lego Star Wars game and, for the love of God, move on to something completely different and pretend that NO MORE than just ONE Lego Star Wars game exists.  That way you won't go crazy when you see just how many DO exist. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Read the reviews and had to get it for my boys (7 & 10). As said in other reviews this is a kids game and it is easy. But it is so creative in the lego format that I'm enjoying playing it with the kids.  What makes it great for me is when one of the boys gets stuck I pick up a controller and jump in to help and when my work is done I drop out. They get my help and they still get to play. Another plus for the game is when a player dies they break into lots of lego pieces. No blood or guts.  If it helps...favorites in our house include Jak and the Ratchet & Clank series.

There are a few slat grooves that are a bit snug but it's not necessary to jam a slat all the way in for structural integrity.Unlike other building sets, you can't really carry your creations with you.

Keeps them soooo busy. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My grandson just loves this! Very nice item and fast shipping too! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My son, who is almost 3, loves construction stuff. He sleeps with books about it, plays with toys that do it, spends hours in the sandpile constructing, and watches construction trucks like a kid who is mezmerized!This toy is great! We were fortunate enough to pick one up off Craigslist for a bit under $100. The family prior never used the excavator attachment as it is rather flimsy and they had no where to use it without breaking it.WE DO! That other reviewer who mentioned most people not having a big pile of sand in their yard wasn't taking about us. No puny sandbox here. 6.5 ton of pure white sand in an 18' sandring will certainly provide the perfect venue for such a large & fun toy. And he happily pedals it down the hill to the bike trail and digs in the loose dirt along the sides like he knows what he's doing. So many uses here for fun.Ours was already assembled and I watched a few YouTube videos on how to use the attachments and scoop. I showed my son and he was off constructing in no time.He loves that it isn't motorized and noisy, he makes those noises himself and it's all imagination. The tractor looks just like the real thing and he likes that part. Kids and adults comment on it all the time, how neat it is.I like that it's large, so he won't outgrow it for a while. It's metal where it needs to be and plastic for weight savings where it's not. The excavator is definately less well made & seems flimsy, so anything heavier or packed will certainly break it. You can use it, but only for sand, water, or dry fine dirt. Not really excavating. And the weight limit will certainly be reached on the excavator well before he outgrows the tractor portion.The steering works really well and is easily turned.

As an adult and a mom and want the best I had to do 4 stars instead of 5 for a few thing's.1. It is easy to assemble but when putting screws in one post the wood started to crack a little bit. I am pretty sure I put the screw in straight. Was not too happy about that. Kind of wish to protect the wood they would of put a metal part in hole to protect the wood when putting screw in.

The top part even seems to dip in a bit also. Not as tight on top as shown.Other then all that I know my 6 year old will love this for Xmas and not care about what I noticed.

The trading, houses, mortgages and rents are within the ability of the 7 year old, with help, but there is no denying its a little on the complicated side.Pay Day is just vastly simpler.  You buy deals if you land on a deal square, which are random businesses that cost a certain amount and will yield a certain amount if sold, and sell them for the listed amount when you land on a buyer square.  If you play the number of months (times around the board) you agree on without finding enough buyers, your stuck with a worthless deal card.  There are also many mail spaces, where you draw mail cards, which are either junk mail which is supposed to be humorous (but often isnt) and bills.  My son, just starting to read, says that every bill is for catfood because one of them is.  Then there are a lot of roll the dice for a lottery type squares.  At the end of the month you get $3500, pay your bills, and 10% interest on any loan you took out.Thats it.  Its both simpler than Monopoly, and customizable in length.  3 months with 4 people is 20-30 minutes, which is perfect for us.Plusses:  A modest dose of strategy (for example, your in the 3rd month, should you buy another deal?) with a healthy dose of learning about money and countingMinusses:  There isn't that much to the game, the mail cards get old, and all the loteries get a little annoying.Verdict:  While perhaps not likely to be a favorite game over a period of years, you will likely enjoy Payday with kids 5-12 or so, at least for a while, or every now and then.

Where they come in handy the most is when you have corners/etc that are fit snuggly/tight that just won't quite let you put 2 pieces of track together.  This statement is meant in 2 ways:1) you're trying to put 2 pieces of track together that are the same on the ends not allowing any track to fit & you need to be able to choose which type ends to have. With these, you can pick & choose which end you want anytime no matter where on the track; and,2)  if you have tracks put together that are snug & have little/no give & just barely can't put them together - these due to the blue edges give that little bend.  It isn't much bend @ all & you don't see it, but it gives just enough flexibility to get track pieces together when you might not have been able to....I hope I explained this clearly.

I don't mean just fun for the kids; my husband and I like playing with it also!My children, two and four, were immediately taken with it. We haven't yet played it as a 'game' but that's really just a bonus interpretation of its uses anyway. It's fun to just stack it in really precarious ways (ie. those other than what's pictured) and see how long you can keep it from toppling while building it up as tall or wide as possible. If you were to build the cactus, as is pictured, it is very attractive and proves to be quite stable. This is nice for shelving the toy when I'm too busy to supervise my youngest with it. The real challenges are not in building what is expected, but are self-imposed; pushing the limits of what can be balanced atop this generally stable base.This toy/game consists of a total of 19 pieces that fit together with a peg-and hole system. Each progressively smaller piece has less holes, and the coral-orange pieces have no holes, and so cannot be built upon. Another reviewer mentioned that the pegs fit loosely in the holes and this is true. A piece will often swivel downward from the weight of a successive piece. This doesn't bother me, but I thought it was worth mentioning.Here are the pieces that come with this set, and their measurements (information that seems difficult to come by per my observation before ordering):- 1 Unfinished Wooden Base (5 holes): 3.5 tall x 2.5 (widest point at top) 1.5 (at bottom)- 3 Large Dark Green Pieces (3 holes): about 3.25 tall x 1.75 wide- 3 Medium Green Pieces (2 holes): 2.75 x 1.5- 3 Medium (Slightly Lighter) Green Pieces (2 holes): 2.75 x 1.5- 3 Small Red Pieces (1 hole) 2 x 1- 3 Small Yellow Pieces (1 hole) 2 x 1- 3 Small Coral-Orange Pieces (0 holes) 2 x 1Of note, especially with the many reviews stating that kids under three love this toy, is that the age recommendations are spot on. If you allow a younger child to play with this toy, it is important to be mindful of the fact that the smaller pieces are precisely the right size to cut off their airway if they were to accidentally swallow one.Other than that already assumed issue I think this is a wonderful toy with the potential to be enjoyed by young and old alike.

I personally thought it was great, but sadly, a lot of people in my gaming groups found this game difficult to play. Two teams sound out three names or phrases on the cards in 30 seconds.

The higher scoring team at the end of the game wins.A fun game that I may try bringing around to my friends again in the future.

Sometimes it is as clear as a bell, other times not so much!  And I have noticed different people hear these phrases differently!  So much fun from pre-teens to adults!(Enrique Iglesias) [SEP]"",""[CLS] My family recently received this MAD GAB as a Christmas gift and played it at a recent family gathering. I had played the game several times before as had some of my siblings, but most of our family had never played before. We had a wonderful time playing the game and it is now included on a list of games for future gatherings. The game revolves around the box of cards. The cards have a list of words on them. Read silently the words don't make much sense, but when read allowed the words sound like familiar phrases, people, places, events, etc. For example, Dock Terse Ooze is Dr. Seuss, Dry Fin Moo Fee is Drive-In Movie, Ace Height Force Oar Rise is `a sight for sore eyes', etc. There are 300 cards total with 4 puzzles per card. The game includes the box of cards, a timer, card flipper, notebook, and rulebook. Like most families with many games, we didn't really follow the official rules and just played. I've played the game with people who are a stickler for the official rules and the game was just as fun. The suggested game winning total is 30 points, but you can play to as many or few points as wish or none at all. There have been some that have suggested that this game is no fun unless you are drunk. I've never been drunk while playing MAD GAB, but I have played the game with drunk people before and the game is just as fun with drunkards as it is playing with sober people. I have also used the game before as a time-filler at the end of class in school and have used the game as a way to give a short lesson about enunciation in high school public speaking classes. The only drawback to the game is that like many word games that require a reservoir of previous knowledge, MAD GAB is not a game that young children will probably understand or relate to very well. They might enjoy listening to some of the hilarious words that are spoken or reading the funny mixed-up words, but they probably will not be able to guess many of the answers. Overall, MAD GAB is an original game that can provide a family with older children hours of family entertainment. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Mad Gab is a very fun and creative game.  It's a team game whereby the team reads the totally random put together words and tries to guess what is really being said.  For example: New Disc Hollow Knee answer: Nudist Colony.  It is great to watch as people clamor for the correct phrase or name, and as the card holder hears it he/she can't understand why the team isn't guessing it when they sound like they are saying it correctly.  If you are an audio person you will have a field day, but if you are a visual person, you will have fits. [SEP]","[CLS] In Mad Gab, a hilarious and easy-to-learn game of words and phrases, it&#8217;s not what you say, it&#8217;s what you hear. Say the words &#8220;Ice Mail Ask Hunk&#8221; a few times and you may hear yourself saying &#8220;I smell a skunk.&#8221; Players work in teams and compete against the clock to solve the phrases and score points. The timer can be adjusted for beginning or expert play and cards also come in two levels of difficulty. For 2 to 12 players. [SEP]",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51IihjbkZJL.jpg
B0009H7H6O,"[CLS] I'm a science buff and want my grandchildren to be at least interested in science if not more deeply involved. So whenever I see a toy that might help ignite or sustain this interest, I'm curious and sometimes yield to the impulse to buy.  EarthBall is a wonderful toy for kids and educational too. Orbis has done a marvelous job of converting a photomosaic of the planet to printed vinyl. The alignment between the printed sections.  The photo detail is surprisngly good. It's far from what you would expect in the pages of National Geographic, but major terrestrial features like deserts, mountains and cultivated areas are visible. You can pick out the Hawaian Islands. Both polar regions are shown. Cleverly they've used luminous ink to print the locations of densely populated areas. It's not super-bright, but it is visible and adds a little something for young minds to absorb.  The EarthBall is durable. My young grandson immediately decided to turn it into an impromptu chair and much to my surprised, it survived.  Overall, it's a fun, worthwhile toy with high play and educational value.Jerry [SEP]"",""[CLS] Standard item, nothing special.  Graphics are somewhat blurry. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I can't wait to have a chance to use this Inflatable Earth Ball in the near future. Looks like a quality piece so I ordered a second. Thanks Gerard [SEP]"",""[CLS] Between you and me, I bought this ball because (1) it's a good (big) size for a toddler and (2) it's more fun than a mounted globe. I am really hoping to get some educational value from it, since my son is showing some interest in maps. In fact, as my wife was inflating it, our son excitedly arrived at her feet and began yelling Earth! Earth! That was great.But immediately, the horseplay ensued. I hope this ball is up to the abuse, because it's not what I intended. But... oh well. After a session of kicking, rolling, throwing and carrying Earth! around the house, the ball seemed no worse for wear, so we sat down for a few minutes of education.The valve stem is at the North Pole, which our boy hasn't quite figured out how to open. Yet. Despite the cloud coverage, the continents are fairly easily discernible. He wanted to know about San Francisco Bay, which is home to us, but it's not really visible on this scale, PLUS is covered in green glow-in-the-dark splotches (the splotches don't really stick out unless I know what *should* be there). Nevertheless, we're on track to learning the continents and the oceans. If he can peg the bay area or even California at some point, that would just be bonus.Meanwhile, I think this ball is going to get a lot more kicking than studying. Its construction isn't heavy duty, but also isn't overly thin like other beach balls I've encountered. And the seams seem sturdy enough to endure indoor play, as long as it isn't being used as an airbag or bouncy horse.Perhaps my one disappointment is the valve isn't the self sealing type found on some inflatables -- the kind that won't let air escape and require a pinch to deflate.In a nutshell, here's a dual-purpose toy I'm pretty happy with, and something I'll buy again when this one succumbs to toddler mayhem.(Update 8/25/11) -- Call me impressed. Despite the cloud coverage and lack of any borders or labels, our 2 year old has no problem identifying San Francisco, Hawaii, Kenya of all places (a neighbor was traveling there), Australia, Antarctica, and naturally, the north pole. We've even talked extensively about earth rotating and sunsets / sunrises, easy to replicate in a dark room with a flashlight. This globe has transitioned from a play thing to a real educational experience!)

Which is probably a good thing because the 2nd bad thing about the mask is that the bottom of it, as it's solid plastic, forms a fairly sharp edge which is pretty dangerous for a 5 year old.If I had to do it again, I'd go for the cheaper costume with a different mask.

Nice and compact for storing in the off season! Easy to set up and fill. Please note: You must put this on level ground. We actually used a section of our deck! It is a nice size for the kids (4,6,8) to splash around and cool off. To help keep the pool clean, we have a foot wash basin next to a one step step stool. One hop and they are in. Overall, we are more than pleased! [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is actually the second time I have purchased this Intex Pool. Not to replace, I needed a second pool. So, that in itself says I was happy with my first purchase enough to when it came time again to buy something like it, I bought the same exact one. The pool was easy to set-up, fill and ultimately use. There was no learning curve with this. It couldn't have been any easier. We used this pool as a baptismal pool.

Finally bought a pool that I think is built to last and will retain the interest of my kids (7 and 4) all summer long.Pros:1)  Easy to set up.  The instructions really hammer the need for a flat surface and that is effectively it.  You inflate the ring, for which they sell a hand pump that was WELL WORTH the eight bucks, and fill the pool.2)  Feels solid.  The material resists puncture well and withstood the four year old's punishment.3)  Size for the price.  Decent amount of room for the entry level pool.  After my wife and I left the pool, the kids did laps around the outer edge and it felt big to them.Cons:  The only con is that you really should buy the cover and the pump, if you don't own a pump.  I always go through a bit of back and forth when I am standing in front of the accessories and wish that the companies would just sell me everything I need in the same box.

B0009QXXB8,"[CLS] Ravensburger has a whole line of puzzles ranging from just a few pieces to the massive 32,000 piece&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Keith-Haring-Double-Retrospect/dp/B00385X4BG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Keith Haring: Double Retrospect</a>&nbsp;puzzle.  I'd love to have one, but I'd have to empty out a room to put it in.  I was the type of kid who always had a puzzle going and would work on them in the basement where there was a piece of plywood set up for them.  I still enjoy them, especially challenging ones, but I must admit most of them just take a bit of time and aren't.  Look at box, search for piece, end of challenge.  I like them to have a bit more of that hmmm, dang quality to them.  In other words, really challenging.The Krypt is perfect.  It's not too big, not too small, and just the perfect puzzle geek challenge.  There are no two pieces alike, but there are similarities between some.  That's essentially where the directions end.  One factor that helps is that one can differentiate the sides by color, removing the guesswork out of which side is which.  There's the nice mixture of round (love it) and straight edge.  The decision is up to the puzzler as to where they want to start.There are not 500 pieces, 1,000, pieces or that whopping 32,000.  The 654 pieces are manageable in most home settings and have just the right amount of geek challenge I enjoy.  I'm leaving the White Mountain puzzles for friends and relatives, but this puzzle is one I'm hogging.  The quality of the pieces is excellent and they have that Soft-Click Technology that enables you to feel/hear when the pieces are in the proper place.  This is one puzzle I'm enjoying because it clicks with my style! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Wow, what was I thinking? Who in their right mind would choose to assemble a blank puzzle. Me and many others!The nice thing is that this is only 654 pieces. If it was a lot more, it would be easily discouraging.The edges were easy enough and since the puzzle has concentric circles for the middle, it makes it easier since pieces are different and odd shapes in certain areas.So the edges, the middle and some of the other pieces are in so far, about one third. I'm finding it easier to place the oddities first since when it gets down to the standard puzzle piece in a standard size, I'm going to be easily frustrated! [UPDATE] It took about four evenings to finish. The kids helped from time to time and it was so cool to keep filling in areas. It went faster the more I did because (obviously) there were less pieces to choose from.I have used the picture sheet which shows where each piece goes. I don't feel like it is cheating because it's no different than looking at the photo that accompanies other puzzles. The fact is that even though you can look at the shape of a piece, it doesn't mean that that piece is obvious. There are plenty of choices that are similar in shape and appearance so it's trial and error. I made a copy of the picture sheet so I could tick off the pieces that are placed to help me keep track of what's done and what's not.Instead of sorting these pieces by color or content, I sort by size and shape. Which makes going through a set of similar pieces easier than continually sorting through them all.There has to be a method or you won't make progress. And believe me, you need some piece placement to encourage you to continue!I did a puzzle a long time ago that was a black cat. All you could discern were the eyes, nose and whiskers. That had a higher piece count, 1,000 pieces, and as I remember, was harder than this. Because the Krypt pieces are varying sizes and silver in tone, it makes it easier to see the outline. The black pieces of my cat puzzle were very difficult to pick out which is why I called this the (almost) ultimate challenge.A great puzzle for those who like a challenge.

I spent some time on it with my wife and we were able to put many of the pieces together. We could have finished it, but it was too tedious for our taste. There's no picture to it -- you have to put the pieces together based on their shape alone. I can see how some people might enjoy it, but it just didn't turn out to be much fun for us.

The next thing I noticed is that even with the stickies wet in the shower, they didn't stick flat to the shower walls. They were stiff and slightly retained their bent shape from being in the bag.

B0009X1FAM,"[CLS] We got these from one of the space theme gift shops at Disney World. The putty is cold, which ironically not what you would expect from Mars.  It is similar to silly putty except harder and firmer in texture;  It takes a while before it flattens on a surface if you leave it lumped as a ball.  If you slap it with your hands, it jiggles like a jelly.  If you drop it on a hard floor, it bounces but not much - just about 5 inches.  You can stretch it as long as you want if you do it carefully, if you do it it too fast it will snap.  My kids love them.  It is educational and they love to experiment with them in different ways.Cleaning:Some of the pieces fell on the carpet and it flattened into a coin the size of a quarter. It was a couple of days after and so they are dry like hard rubber.  I needed to pry it with my nails, not so bad as the putty do not penetrate deeply.  But a few pieces also fell on the car seat with a fabric cover.  Under the extreme heat of the sun which reached more than 100 degrees, the mud sipped much deeper into the fabric. I needed to rub it,  moisten it, rub it, moisten it, before it comes off.  The good thing about it is it did not leave a stain on the fabric (Although I cannot be sure the same thing would happen if the fabric is in lighter colors).Do not leave them uncovered after playing, just like Play Doh, it dries up and will not go back to its old form even if you moisten it.Taiwan.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] First, you have to play this game with the right group of people.  And you do require a large group (definitely 8 or more). But when you do find a group, this makes for an awesome game.  Its hilarious to see people argue with each other when they're trying to determine who the werewolves are.  I've seem multiple strategies used successfully in this game from remaining silent while others argue, accusing another werewolf of being the culprit (I like that one because then people are SURE you are human), and voting for the players you know are the biggest threats first.The one thing to note about this game is it requires a sort of story teller.  This person is essentially in charge of coordinating the game and progressing the game from day to night.  That job function should be reserved for people that are experienced with the game.  It also helps to have someone that can tell stories and make things up such as As the morning sun starts to rise, everyone hears an ear-piercing shriek from Amanda.  As you all come to her aid, you find her standing over what remains of the latest victim of the werewolves.  Nick, you didn't make it through the night.

There are also some assorted variety of characters, which add for interesting twists. A moderator helps dictate the flow of the game. The villagers go to sleep at night. A wolf or wolves murder them. In the day, the villagers vote and try to rid the town of these dastardly wolves! It is a simple premise but has tremendous gameplay because of the strategy each person may choose to employ to ensure their own survival. It works if the people you play with are naturally creative, competitive, or dramatic.  All you need is an open mind.  It is similar to Killer or Mafia.I played this with my family and some family friends (ages 18 to 55). It took a few rounds of explanation because some of the more experienced players were trying to instruct people on how to do best strategies. I think it's easiest if you just do a simple round first and then slowly add in more and more of the special characters to intensify the game.We ended up playing for hours. If you like group scenarios, you may like this very much! [SEP]"",""[CLS] If you're having a dinner party or looking for a game to break the ice with a medium-sized group of people (8-16 or so) then Werewolves is a fantastic choice.  It's a game of deception and secrecy, where the group tries to figure out who is a werewolf and who is a townfolk (which is randomly decided at the beginning of the game) through their ability to figure out who is lying and who is telling the truth.  This is a great dinner part game, a fantastic ice breaker if you have guests who don't know each other, and just an all around great time.The only real negative with this game is that it requires a decent amount of up-front explanation from the narrator.  If you don't have someone familiar with the game, then the first few rounds can be a real mess while people try to figure out the rules.  So if you're running this game for the first time, then either be sure to have at least one veteran who is confidant explaining the rules or consider running a practice game or two with a smaller group in order to get a hang of things.

B000AK9E66,"[CLS] I am a teacher and, on occasion, I teach other teachers. I recently ran a workshop called Game Kids Play and one of the assignments was for each teacher to bring in a game that they either have used in the classroom or that they think would be good to use in the classroom. Each teacher would give us a mini lesson on how to play the game and then we would get in groups and spend X amount of time at each game. Some of the great games included Blokus, Rumis, Catchphrase, Spy Alley, and Blink. However, Whoonu stole the show!We ended up playing this game far longer than any of the others. Most of the teachers ended up buying it soon after. The person who brought it in is a middle school teacher and she said she liked to use it with her special needs students throughout the year.I highly recommend it! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My kids loved this game and want to play it all the time.  The only problem is the reading.  The kids that enjoys it most need help reading some or most of the cards.  Still, it's nice to have a game they can play that isn't as simple as Candy Land or Memory. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My family really likes Cranium Whoonu, as do their friends who come to our home. We bring the game out 2-3 times a week and play a few quick rounds.As others have noted, you are given cards, one person is the whoozit, and then you select cards from your hand that you think will be the whoozit's favorite thing.The whoozit then places the cards in order of preference next to point tokens - his favorite thing will be next to the highest point token, his next favorite thing next to the next highest point token, and so on. This ranking is actually a very nice feature of the game, EVERYONE ends up with a token so you don't have one child who ends up empty handed every time (as has happened to us with Apples to Apples, for instance).We are always amused and surprised by how the whoozit actually ranks his cards - who knew my oldest son hated zoos because of all the hills he has to walk? Who knew my daughter preferred remote controls to fairs?This game requires reading, but otherwise, there is no reason to wait for a child to be eight before playing [SEP]"",""[CLS] I was out shopping last night, and was debating between several Cranium games. I finally decided on Whoonu, because it seemed like a game that anyone can play, including my 8 year old son.Based on the packaging, I figured it was a guess how well you know the other person type game. You pick two cards and ask someone What do you like better--roller coasters or building snowmen?Well, it's a little more complicated than that.One person--who's birthday is coming up the soonest--becomes the first Whoozit. Everyone EXCEPT the Whoozit is given four cards and, out of the four cards, you have to guess which two would be the Whoozit's favorite. Each person puts their two selected card in the Whoonu envelope and gives the envelope to the Whoozit. (This is for 3-4 players. Games with 5 or 6 players require only ONE card to be selected.)The Whoozit then takes out the cards and puts them in order of least favorite to most favorite. Depending on how many people are playing, there are stacks of chips ranging from 1 point to 6 points--the least favorite being worth 1 point with the most favorite earning the highest point. (For example, if you're playing with 3-4 players, the highest chip would be 4 points.)The other two players get chips that correspond to the placement (favorites) of the Whoozit. For example, if I chose Bugs and Black Licorice for the Whoozit's favorites and he places Bugs as most favorite, then I get a 4 point chip. If he chooses Black Licorice as his LEAST favorite, I get the 1 point chip.Here's the tricky (and not so fun) part: the NEXT Whoozit (the person on the left of the previous Whoozit) gets the DISCARDED cards from the other players PLUS 2 or 3 new cards (depending on how many people are playing). Not only can this get confusing, but it can get FRUSTRATING. If a card that NO ONE likes is in play (say, Watching Race Car Driving), then that card stays in play.My family and I played last night, but we had to help our son with some parts. He grew tired after ONE game, so my husband and I decided to play. We realized that AT LEAST 3 players are required for gameplay, so we made up our own rules.It's not a bad game, but not as fun as I thought it would be. I can't see how people think this would be a good game for strangers--or for team building and ice breaking. I mean, guessing the favorites of a total stranger is NOT fun (for me, anyway). Who CARES what the favorites are of a complete stranger?! It's much more fun to learn more about people you actually KNOW--friends, family, and romantic partners.If the premise sounds appealing to you, you'll likely enjoy this game. There are 3 packs of cards--300 in all--so there's plenty for playing according to rules without much repeats...or for playing according to your own rules.

B000ASAV3S,"[CLS] I like the Kid Galaxy Claw Climber, but with reservations and caveats. Note: This review is identical to one I wrote for the Cheetah model.  The two are identical except for the color and theme.  I liked the Cheetah enough to get the Tiger.  Despite my reservations, these are cool remote control cars to own.First, new users might find it difficult to even get this thing going because nowhere in the brief directions does it explain how to turn it on. There's an on/off switch on the controller which is obvious, but not so on the car. It took a few minutes, but I finally found the tiny switch on the side of the car that turned it on. This isn't a permanent problem, obviously, since once you know that's the end of it. But it sure would have been nice to have just put that in the directions!The recommend age range for this item is 5-15. To that I'd emend to 5-8 with likely some adult supervision with 9-12 being the upper end of the target age. Here's why:The hubs that lock in the claws on the tires do not work easily or consistently. Can't image a 5 or 6 year old having the patience for that. Some will, many will not.As for why I don't think this is for older kids, say above 12, this has a max range in my experience of about 60 feet. You'd be best to keep the vehicle within 40 feet because you can lose the signal very very easily after 50 feet. I think an older kid is going to want a vehicle with a longer range. Also, the purpose of this car is mostly off-road to some degree. It can't do impossible climbs, but it can handle a very rocky road. But speed? Not so much. Could be just me, but I think an older kid is going to want speed over slower off road capability. Then again, your mileage may vary.Also, as another reviewer noted, the controls really aren't intuitive. Left and right are in the up/down position. Why on earth do that?! Very annoying. But I think a user can get used to it with time and use.Overall, this seems like an okay remote control car for the price. If you want something sturdier you'll need to pay more. Ditto something faster. But for something to go over small obstacles this can be fun. But again, I do think that view decreases considerably the more you get above age 12 or so. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This thing is AWESOME!  We tested it all over our apartment complex, which has tons of rocks, bricks, grass, dirt, hills, and it was always able to move around because of the claws on the wheels.  My son is obsessed with this toy now and we take it everywhere.  I'm pleased with how rugged it is, and the batteries last a long time in it, which is nice and rare when you compare it to other toys! [SEP]"",""[CLS] wow, is this thing rugged.  OK, my son has been having fun playing with this thing.  It is not Top quality, but it has survived his beatings.  He has played with it a few times and has enjoyed himself.  He has a lot of RC type vehicles, and this one will be added to his top 5 list.  I think he finds the tires to be interesting in how they move with the claws.  I would say this isn't his favorite, or the most well made, but it is not too bad.  We will see if it stands the test of time/wear. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I have a 9 year-old son and a soon-to-be 7 year-old daughter. They have a variety of RC cars, trucks, motorcycles and more. These would have been triple digit, high dollar toys when I was growing up. Heck, they might have been spy technology back then!  Now, they are just one in a crowded field of many.So, should you buy THIS RC car/vehicle for your child? Maybe so... I'll tell you why.But first, let me tell you about something that may give you some insight on my perception. Not too long ago, we made a major paradigm shift in our household. I invested in a pretty good amount of rechargeable batteries and charger systems.  I'm not sure if I've broken even yet, but I think that I'm close. I also made a major investment in Lithium (non-rechargeable) batteries as well. I try to match the correct battery to the correct application and I think that I'm starting to save some decent money.For this vehicle, rechargeable is the way to go. Even when it eats batteries, it isn't that big of a deal because we just pull the set in the charger out, and put the other set in and go - pennies instead of dollars.  My point in this, is that we don't consider battery life as important in our rating as we used to consider it.  If you are still buying alkalines, this vehicle does chew through batteries at a high rate. But honestly, all RC vehicles do...Moving on from there, and contributing to the four star review, is an unusual layout on the remote control. I didn't find it very difficult to get used to but these days, with so many things programmable anyway, it would be nice if you could change it up and control it the way you would prefer.Also, I haven't had this problem yet, but this broadcasts on the same frequency spectrum as many wi-fi routers so it is possible that you could have interference. I haven't seen it yet, and it may not use the exact frequency as our wi-fi, but I've had other 2.4Ghz vehicles that interfered. It does have several channels you can switch through if this happens, but sometimes even that won't cure it. Again, I haven't had it happen yet with mine, but the possibility exists that you might find your wi-fi interrupting if you are on the same frequency.As for the claws, I agree with other users, I can foresee some surgery having to be done down the line in order to remove mulch, grass or sticks. And the knob to bring the claws in and out is not great. It isn't a A+ quality machine. It is a B quality design, or C+ but the price kind of makes up for it, there's a decent amount of bang for the buck on this toy and kids love it even if adults are wishing it was a little better made.I will say, it CAN climb over stuff that a lot of cars won't, but a good rubber tired vehicle could keep up with it. The claws are half marketing, half functionality and half exaggeration. Yes, I know.Should you buy it?  It IS fun. The Tiger / Cheetah / Rhino thing adds fun to it for the kids. My son loves Hippopotamus for some reason, and if they had one of those, he wouldn't let me pass it up. So if you've got a kid who is into Cheetahs, or Rhinos or Tigers then this is a neat toy. The claws are fun. It works fairly well. I give it four stars at the approximately $30 price point they seem to sell for most of the time. Five stars if you found it for less.  It's a fun little RC toy. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is one of three Character styled dune buggy vehicles.  It is a medium sized remote control four wheeler with a fully independent suspension.  The body is solid but it's not built for watery terrain.  The tires have unique claws that come out, imparting some additional traction.  However, control is sacrificed as the driver has to constantly adjust the right to left turning tendencies.  There is more stability when the claws are retracted.  You can make a front end alignment, though.As for traction, I tested this on my grass lawn, mulch bed, up a hilly driveway, up a hilly mulch bed and hilly grassy knoll.  The only things that you shouldn't drive this upon is mud or a watery terrain.Control is through a non-conventional two button, four directional remote.  It takes a short learning curve to drive it properly.This is louder than the usual remote controlled vehicles but it's a lot of fun.It does use a lot of batteries (2 AAA for the remote and 6 AA for the vehicle).

The face is very detailed, with different and realistic fur and other details. There are details under the paws. Even the tail is sized well and detailed. You can get a lot of educational value because of the realism: you can discuss the size of the paws for running fast, the stripes for camouflage, etc.The one shortcoming is that it isn't very poseable except the tale.

We ended up just showing all our cards to each other to finally figure it out.The clues given by the butler are slightly obscure, but we have learned after the first case that you must LISTEN CLOSELY, REPEAT, PAUSE, and WRITE IT ALL DOWN!  From these clues you are supposed to deduct certain things and check off multiple items/locations/times/suspects.  This the part that I don't think a 10 year old could grasp, when 3 intelligent adults couldn't.There is really not any point of even using the game board, w/the 10 cases  you have very little interaction with the board.  It doesn't make it clear when to move, what ends your turn, and w/3 players, after you run out of item cards from the butler, the board is useless.After the 1st case, they did explain how we were to have deduced the clues given by the butler and the inspector, which will help in solving future cases, but I'm not sure whey they didn't just give you an example on the DVD in the first place.We have not tried general play, but I did read it is just like playing regular clue, only you also have the DVD interaction.My suggestion, if you are a clue fanatic and collect the games, then buy it, although I'd check eBay for a cheaper price.  If you do not have the patience to wait for the DVD to trigger an event and are used the old style play, don't waste your money.  I'm not unhappy I bought it as I do collect them, but I wish I would have paid a lot less. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I was really excited to get this game and to play it.....there were 6 adults attempting to play it and we were all very confused! It was so frustrating that we just stopped playing on two different occasions and I just gave this game away. We read the directions but they were not clear and the DVD is not self explanatory. There are a lot of choices that need to be made and people were confused about the game play. I was disappointed in this game and will just stick to board game clue from now on! [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a fun game once you get the hang of it.That is the key, getting the hang of the game. As other reviewers mentioned this game has a learning curve to it and it is not the easiest game to play right at first. This is not something an 8 or 9 year old will easily be able to do by themselves.Once you do understand how it works the game is quite fun and although it is very similar to the old Clue this one is different. You have to figure out four things and there are more options (Something like 10 options) under each category. You will get extra clues from players, from the dvd butler and maid and from watching little clips on the dvd.My ten year old loved the game and thinks this is better than the normal clue game. My 8 year old daughter would rather  play the original Clue game over this one. I grew up playing Clue so this was a lot of fun.I think it is correct, as one reviewer did, that if you are a Clue fanatic you will probably love this game. IF you like puzzles, solving riddles and want something a bit harder than the original Clue you will probably enjoy this game. However, for many people this may be a bit too much and not worth the effort.Enjoy [SEP]"",""[CLS] No review here really explains how to use this DVD system. As you can see, many reviewers (including this one) were confused by the operation of the DVD.It's important to note that the DVD does not drive the game or follow along with the game. The DVD does not track whose turn it is or where each player is on the board. When you first start the game the DVD will only light up two options: use a secret passage and make an accusation. You won't be making accusations until near the end of the game, so the only options seems to be the secret passage and that's confusing all of us. The other options are all gray.I just spoke to HASBRO today and the lady mentioned that you may have to play 15 or 20 minutes before the DVD starts doing anything. You just play the board game like normal at first, you don't use the DVD at all after it instructs you how to setup the board and game play begins. After several turns you may use the DVD when you are in a room where you want to use a secret passage. The DVD may tell you that something unexpected happens while you are traversing the passage. Eventually after possibly 10s of minutes, the DVD may do something. The DVD works on a timer. The DVD senses how much time has passed and starts yielding the clues as time goes on. What will happen is that as the DVD just sits there on the options screen, seemingly doing nothing other than looping thru its music and watermark animation, it's actually counting time. It assumes that you are playing the Clue game just like normal. At some random time interval, the DVD will come to life and the inspector will say I would like to see you right now. Then you can use the remote control to answer the inspector and he will play a clue for you. After that he may turn on one of the other options like call the butler and then you may start using that option. As the game progresses more of the options will become available.To answer some concerns that other reviewers have mentioned:It should be noted that a DVD is of limited intelligence. It's not a general purpose programming medium so it can't be as smart as a normal computer program. It was never intended to do anything as smart as play a game, so it's only clever programming that gets it to simulate the intelligence it needs. As such you shouldn't expect too much out of it.The 10 fixed cases in the Clue DVD game allow custom animation. For example, if Miss Scarlet stole the broach at midnight, a dramatic animated scene can be scripted such that Mr. Boddy tells of how Miss Scarlet tried on the broach and he knew that she was an incorrigible night owl. For this kind of content the fixed cases are a must. With a normal computer program it might be able to shuffle predetermined scenes or lines of dialog to match a random case, but the DVD is not that smart. So the fixed cases are a compromise of allowing nifty Clue scripts to be played at the expense of having a finite number of Clue cases on the DVD. The DVD also includes a random case but that's not going to feature the custom story line and animated snippets. It's going to be more generic.You could just play regular Clue with it, you don't have to use the DVD. Compared to Classic Clue it's a deluxe game with the cute dolls, 3D colorful game board, and the expanded possibilities. Compared to the standard Clue game this one is missing the weapons so that's too bad. If you don't like the expanded possibilities because it makes the game longer, just eliminate some cards at the start. [SEP]",[CLS] Step out of your living room and into the mystery.

B000B6UVJ8,"[CLS] here's an example of a toy with a great idea but poor product.  My son received this car for his first birthday.  He likes it and by 16 months learned to push the button to make it go.  But after 4 months of light use it stopped rolling.  New batterys don't help.  It sounds like it's working but won't roll.  Dad is taking it apart to try to fix it but we shouldn't have to resort to that in just 4 months.  Aside from that, a major downside is that there is no automatic shutdown.  If your toddler loses interest in the toy after a few minutes (they all do), the car continues to make noise until someone gets up to shut it down (draining the battery).  Seems like a small thing but it gets annoying.  For the price, it may be acceptable to some.  Aside from its problems it's perfect for toddlers.  There is just one button to push to make it go; push it once and it goes in forward; push it again and it turns to the left; push it again it goes forward again.  So it's not something you can truly steer or anything but it does give a toddler a sense of control.  If they could add a auto shutdown feature and improve the reliability it could be a great little toy. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My son got this when he was a year old.  He was scared of it at first because it's really loud.  It makes constant engine sounds and beeping when it's turning.  My husband put clear packing tape over the speaker and it was still fairly loud, especially on hard floors.  It worked well on our carpet though and was slighly quieter.I wish it had an automatic shutoff though, because the engine sounds go on forever if you don't shut it off, and a one year old doesn't do that on his own when he's done playing with it.He didn't figure out the button very well to make it go where he wanted on his own, but he still enjoyed it anyway. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a very durable, very easy to use car - perfect for a toddler. Good size, and easy to hold remote control. Sounds great, right? Sure, if you can stomach the noise, which is AWFUL and cannot be turned down or off. Save yourselves, run far, run fast - don't buy this product. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 15 month old loves this car. We bought it after the Chicco remote car turned out to be a dud. It has a good range and the remote is perfect for little hands. Ignore the other reviewers, so it's loud, turn it off when not using it. Not rocket science. It's really a great toy. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas, having loved other Parents brand toys we've bought for her. My daughter's initial reaction was fear. It's extremely loud, and needlessly so. I suppose the level of noise is supposed to imitate that of a real car, but it's really just annoying if you're a parent, and a little scary if you're a one-year old.Once she became acclamated to the level of noise it made, it did hold her interest. At the very least she found the remote to be a good chew toy, and was pleasantly surprised that the button on it did in fact move the car about. Assuming she was close enough to the car. Someone said the range is about 15 feet. Maybe they modified our model of the car to be even crappier. Once the car got about 4-5 feet away, it was hesitant to respond and acted a bit squirrely even when it did respond. At 15 feet (less, really) the remote became totally useless.I figured in time my daughter would get the hang of all these nuiances and it would probably provide a few minutes of entertainment here and there. Time was not on our side. The toy broke less than two weeks after Christmas. The remote no longer works at all - and the batteries are fine. The car will turn on, and noisily sit there with its flashing lights, but that's it. Needless to say, the small token of fun value this toy had is gone.Don't waste your money on this toy - it's a guaranteed disappointment.

The cards are durable and of good quality. They can be used in a variety of ways ! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Interesting teaching technique with the cards and pictures.  Great idea as long as the subject material fits the student well. It needs to have a purpose.  Sea life might be a stretch for most. The system is a great idea. Subject matter is key. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Multiple languages aside, what sets these Lang-O-Learn flashcards apart from others is the photographic images. With these, learners can get a basic idea as to where to find the objects, such as the pig on the hay, the harvester in the field, and the dog near a house. It's not done in such a way that learners can't tell the main object, however. While teaching the cards, instructors can help students learn by creating sentences, such as, The rabbit is black and white, The pitch fork picks up the hay, or The cow says 'Moo.'The seventeen languages on the back are indicated by a symbol to help instructors or self-learners know which language each is by using the key, and those that don't use the common alphabet have the words spelled out in the best English pronunciation possible. Still, ultimately it's a guess as to how to properly pronounce the words.The cards themselves feel like a thin, petite postcard, and I like the sturdy two-piece box so I don't have to worry about my children ripping off the top. All in all, I enjoyed using these with my kids, and I think they would work very well in classrooms or in homeschooling. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My youngest daughter has had some development problems in regards to speech. We use a lot of flash cards with her and these have been instrumental in teaching her to verbalize the different parts of her body. Now when she gets a boo boo she can tell us where it hurts instead of just pointing to the area. There is, however, room for improvement.First, if you plan on using the cards often or letting your child handle the cards you should consider laminating them. They are printed on basic card stock and won't hold up to a lot of wear and tear. Second, while the body parts are named in different languages you have to use a card as a key to figure out which language is which. It would have made a lot more sense to just list the languages next to the words. To me that isn't a big deal as we are only focusing on English right now, but it could be a problem for those who actually want to teach their child the different languages.Overall it's a great deck but we are personally making some adjustments, such as laminating the cards. The card stock may not be great but the printing job is excellent. It's done wonders for teaching our daughter how to name the parts of her body. Highly recommend if you have a little one who needs a bit of help with verbal communication. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My wife has been a Speech and Language Pathologist for over twenty-five years. She's used many tools working with children and adults over the years. Flashcards are great tools to help teaching language but in most cases multiple languages isn't necessary. The box looks like its going to be a huge set but there are only twenty cards with half of the box filled with a piece of foam. It's good to learn your fruits and vegetables but there are more important things to learn like being able to tell someone you actually need something. This could be a good set if you need to expand your set of tools but it's really limited. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This set of multi-language cards based on the body parts is very educational but for 10$ very basic. It is 20 different cards or parts listed in 17 languages. The languages are listed in a key on a separate card so you do have to keep referring to that card to know which language is which at first. The languages are also given a symbol. There is no pronunciation help with the different languages which is a hindrance, and for 10$ you should get more than 20 cards and know how to say the words not just see them printed. My son's home school flash cards only cost 2.99 and there are 100 cards. The cards themselves look nice but are non-laminated paper so you will have to be careful if using these with children or if using them frequently. Personally I feel these would have been better had they included pronunciation for each word for each language, and if there had been more cards or better quality cards. Also, I feel some of the pictures are vague such as the back picture which shows the entire backside of a person. The back is not pointed out but rather you just look and see the word, but for a younger child that may not be obvious. The pictures are well done and bright however. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The cards are impractical for me to use with my kids. But others will find them fantastic. They certainly are good in many ways even though for me they don't work.The reason they're not right for me to use with my kids is the tiny printing on the back that I personally have trouble reading even with my reading glasses. The printing is too small and I think others with better eyesight will make good use of the cards.Even though the printing on the back is too small for me to use with my kids, I do like the pictures on the fronts of the cards. The pictures are excellent. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is an excellent set of photo cards!  There are 20 photos of farm animals, barns and implements,with the identifying word on the back, repeated in 17 different languages.

Real photos always work best for kids withe developmental delays, so the therapeutic value of these cards is obvious.I don't think the value for those learning other languages is as clear.  Each of the language translations appear in a list on the back of the card.  Each different language is indicated by a code symbol, which you then have to check against the master list to determine which language is which.  There is no pronunciation help for any of the languages.While I think these cards will be a great choice for young learners with developmental delays, they aren't all that sturdy and it's unlikely they will last long.  In many ways, this is a great product for the right audience.  There are some key problems though that make this set just okay and a cautious investment.

B000BHBUCO,"[CLS] This is a family and party-friendly card game based on medieval class structure...when life wasn't fair (is it now?).  We enjoy playing it as a family: children aged 14, 13, 11, and 6.  They all like it.Each round of the game takes a short time to play, but you can play as many or as few rounds as you like.  There is no score to keep, and there is no time limit.  Who knows, you may be lucky enough to start out as the Greater or Lesser Dalmuti (royalty) who collect taxes (the best cards) from the Greater and Lesser Peons (in which case you won't be so lucky).Game play is as follows.  When you get ready to start playing each player is assigned a seat based on the card they draw from the deck: the person who draws the strongest card gets to start at the Great Dalmuti to the person who draws the weakest card and who starts as the Greater Peon.  Once seated, the cards return to the deck, the cards are shuffled and dealt by the Greater Peon.  The Greater Dalmuti then calls for taxes (the best cards from the peons), and play commences.  The goal of each round is to get rid of your cards as quickly as possible.  The person who goes out first during a round gets to be the Greater Dalmuti for the next round.  The last person to go out is the Greater Peon.  This goes on as long as you want to play.  Oh, watch out for the occasional revolution - when a person is dealt two jesters they can declare a revolution...a way to level the playing field making it easier to dethrown a Dalmuti.We have additional fun while playing this game by role-playing the social status you have each round.  As the Great Dalmuti you can be either benevolent or oppressive.  As a peon you can be submissive or defiant.  And the merchants can try to schmooze with royaly. We also enjoy having friends over to play.  We play a round, then while the new Greater Peon shuffles and deals, the rest of us hit the snack table.  Anyway, it's a grand game.The English language version of this game was out of print for at least a few years, and you could get copies only at on-line auction sites like e-bay.  During those lean years an English language copy of the Great Dalmuti in good condition could run as much as $50/game, and I had to replace my lost English copy with an affordable German language copy.  I'm extremely pleased to see that Hasbro has brought the English language version of this Wizards of the Coast classic back to the shelves!I have been a Great Dalmuti player for nearly 10 years, and I look forward to many more years of good times with the Great Dalmuti.This is definitely a 5-star game.  If you don't have a copy, you NEED one! Christmas is coming. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This game is really fun if you don't take it too seriously. It's easy to learn and a good game to play with kids or adults. Can also be fun at a party with some drinking and lot of people. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Bought for gift. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a classic game that has a variety of generic names.The artwork is great, and the role-playing aspect of the game offer additional opportunities for fun.The rebellion possibility adds some excitement to the game too. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This game has been a favorite of ours for game parties for quite a while.The Great Dalmuti is based on medieval class structure, which was, of course, not equitable at all.  In those days there were royalty, merchants, and peasants.  Similarly, in this game there is the royalty, referred to as the Greater Dalmuti and the Lesser Dalmuti.  There are also players representing merchants, and one player designated as the Lesser Peon and one designated as the Greater Peon, i.e., the peasants.As you might guess, being one of the royalty is great - you get to collect taxes from the peons, but being a peon stinks - you have to pay taxes to the royalty.  Being a merchant is OK, but you don't get in on the whole tax collecting scene, though, at the same time you don't have to pay any taxes either.All right, here's how the game works.  This is a card game that we have played with as many as 10 people at a time, though it seems to work best with between 5 and 8 players, as indicated in the rules.The card deck includes one-1, two-2s, three-3s, and so on up to twelve-12s.  The 12s are the weakest cards in the deck, and the one is the most powerful.  There are also two jester cards.  These cards, if played by themselves, are weaker than a twelve, but when played with another card a jester card takes on the value of any card it is played with.Play proceeds as follows:1) When you get ready to play the first round the players need to be seated.  This is done as each player draws a card from the deck.  The player drawing the lowest numbered (and thus the most powerful card) become the Greater Dalmuti, and so on, so that the player drawing the weakest card becomes the Greater Peon.2) Players should be seated in order around the table or around a room going from the Greater Dalmuti down to the Greater Peon.  Once that is done the game becomes more fun as players take on attitudes and perspectives of their social positions.  That is, the Greater and Lesser Dalmutis can be either magnanamous leaders, or they can be overbearing tyrants.  At the same time Peons can be either subservient or uppity.3) The Greater Peon then collects all the cards back from the players once they have been seated, and the Greater Peon shuffles the deck, and deals out a hand of cards to each player, dealing until all the cards have been dealt.4) The Great Dalmuti then calls for taxes.  When this happens the Great Peon has to give her/his two most powerful cards (not including jesters) to the Greater Dalmuti.  The Lesser Peon, likewise has to give their single strongest card to the Lesser Dalmuti.  The Dalmutis then give whichever cards they like to the Peons (usually weak cards).5) Play commences as the Greater Dalmuti lays down whatever they desire, say a pair of 11s.  Another player can then play only if they have a pair of cards of a lower (more powerful) number, e.g.,a pair of 8s.  Play continues around the circle of players until everyone passes.  At that point the player than played the most powerful pair of cards starts the next round.6) Play continues in this manner until everyone has played all of their cards.  The player that gets rid of their cards first is seated as the Greater Dalmuti for the next round, and so on around the circle, and the last person to go out becomes the Greater Peon.7) You can play as many rounds as desired.8) We like to have a snack table set up where players can get something to snack on between rounds (while the new Greater Peon shuffles and deals hands for the next round - heh heh heh).We find this game to be enhanced by providing a variety of hats to be worn by players - e.g., a crown for the Greater Dalmuti, and an assortment of other hats to be worn by merchants and peons.  We also like to add other perks to positions of high station.  For example, we like to seat the Greater Dalmuti in a comfy couch, and the Greater Peon on a small wooden stool, or even on the floor.  Thus adding an extra element of class structure to the game.All is not lost for Peons, though.  There is always the possibility of a revolution.  You'll need to read the rules to find out about that.This is a great family or party game.  You and your friends will love it.5-stars all the way! [SEP]","[CLS] A light card game where players gain status by going out first. The 80-card commercial deck contains cards ranked from 12 to 1, along with two Jesters. Each card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck. In other words, there are twelve 12s, eleven 11s, four 4s and a single card ranked 1. The lower the number, the better the rank. The deck is dealt out to all players and the object is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. The hand begins with one person playing one or more card to the center of the table. The cards played must all be of the same rank (although Jesters are wild, and may be played with any other cards). Each player in turn must now either play the same number of cards of a better rank, or pass. Play continues around the table until everyone has passed; at that point, the cards are cleared and whoever played the last set of cards leads the next round. After everyone has gone out, the players are ranked. For example, the person who first got rid of all his cards becomes The Great Dalmuti. Players change seat position to represent the new hierarchy and begin another round. The Great Dalmuti is generally played for many rounds.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] Performs tricks very well.  Does take a while to build up and tear down.  However, I'm very satisfied with purchase.  I have bought the local cheap kites when the kids needed them during vacations.  This one is an outstanding value compared to the local kite store. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Before buying the kite I knew that there would be some training that went with flying it.  I'd say I spent a total of 2 hours over two days learning how to fly it before being somewhat successful at keeping it afloat.  The first day I never kept it in the air more than two seconds.Four things I learned from experimenting was:1.) You have to unravel the strings completely before flight unlike other kites in which you let the string unravel while in flight.  Upon retrospect, it was the only way to do it because there are two handles and there is almost no way to simultaneously unwind both handles so that you don't tug on one side more than the other. The string is only about 50' long so there's not a whole lot of space required.2.) You need more wind than your ordinary kite.  This thing hardly gets off the ground, let alone stay in flight without some good wind.  I'm estimating it requires between 10-15 mph wind.3.)  It's a lot easier with two people.  I flew this kite with my daughter as we both learned together.  It was fun learning but still a lot of work.  The instructions say that you can yank the kite to get it in flight.  That is partially true, but we also had to continually walk backwards to keep steady tension on the line for the kite to get really airborne.  We found it easier for one person to hold the kite in the desired position while the other person yanked it to get it going.  We also found that the second person was good for retrieving the kite after a crash which cut down on the non-flying time.  Because of the way the kite has to be positioned to start and because of how much a beginner will be crashing the kite, it would be a lot of running back and forth with just one person.4.) Don't fly it around small children.  The kite can go into a nose dive rather easily, and when it does, it comes down fast and hard.  If an adult were to be hit by it, he/she would be in pain let alone a child.  While you're learning and getting the hold positions right there will be a lot of crashing the kite.  We flew the kite on grass so not much damage was done, plus the kite is very durable.I think it's a worthwhile purchase for those looking to take kite flying to the next level and are ready to be committed to it.

These cool little knights should be available for about $4.00 on the Internet & be eligible for super saver shipping.  The greed continues.  Caveat emptor.As far as the figures go, they are nicely done.  The painting is reasonably well done for a mass market item.

I like the small size as well, although I do wish they were more proportional. We are a big fan of the Safari Ltd toobs.

Concepts are so much easier for them to grasp if they can hold and play with the things they're leaning about, rather than just reading about them in a book.

They also have their names on the underside in case you need help identifying what they are. Most of the pieces in this set stand up on their own fairly well.The only thing I find a little cumbersome is the tube itself. While it's great for storing, it's compact size and odd shape makes it difficult to get the figures in and out - the rope handle also seems to get in the way.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] Many of my old toys weren't so good.  But colorforms were the real deal.  My grandson spent two hours last night perfecting his picture on the big window in his room.  The pieces stuck, and didn't leave a residue, other than fingerprints.  He is three, and was completely involved in the simple premise of this toy.  I loved it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] These simple, geometric Colorforms are such a great IDEA for a toy. They are open-ended, encouraging children to imagine their own stories and scenarios rather than regurgitate what they've seen on television. They teach numbers, shapes, colors, counting, sorting. They foster creativity.It's for all these reasons that I ordered a set for my kids. These reasons, and nostalgia.In fact, I have such fond memories of this toy from my own childhood that it pains me to say this: but these Colorforms are just plain GROSS. As soon as I opened the box I regretted ordering them, overwhelmed as I was with a noxiously potent, plastic smell of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The smell was bad enough that I returned them for the smell alone, but even so there were other problems. The Colorforms were discolored. Quite a few were peeling off their boards, leaving an oily residue in places. Ew. And yet the box itself was sealed and did not look tampered with in any way. Maybe they'd been sitting in a hot warehouse for awhile, outgassing their nasty stuff, and that explains the smell and the discoloration and the oily residue, but jeez. I'd rather find out that they degrade like this NOW, before I give them to my young children, then LATER, after my kids have been playing with them for awhile.Now, supposedly the manufacturer of Colorforms doesn't use phthalates in its PVC; but judging by what I smelled and saw, whatever it's using in place of phthalates can't be good for little lungs and little fingers. And really, with or without phthalates, PVC is bad enough (for human health as well as for the environment) that its use in children's toys ought to be questioned. PVC degrades into dioxins. Some of its additives include endocrine disruptors, heavy metals, and suspected carcinogens. Yeah.I knew all this about PVC when I ordered the box, so what on earth was I thinking?? Those nostalgic thoughts, I suppose. Well, so much for nostalgia. I'll stick with eco-friendly, child-safe wool felt boards or magnetic boards from now on. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We gave this as a gift to a 5 year old girl. The child liked it well enough, but it is definately something that has more educational value than the OMGoshhhh factor. I honestly do not know if she has continued to play with it, but I hope so. I suspect that a child interested in building would be more appreciative. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Only thing is I didn't remember how big it was. I intended to take it on a plane ride, but once it got here I see it's much too big for that to be reasonable.I should've checked the product information more thoroughly. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Colorforms were first marketed in 1951 and I was probably a bit too old for them. I frankly don't remember if we got them for our son or not. That too was a long time ago.  Now I have grandchildren whom I indulge. Of course, nearly everything I get them is something thst I think I'd enjoy.  On that point, Colorforms rate high. They are ideal for a young imagination - or an old one.  The concept is elegantly simple: die-cut vinyl pieces that adhere to glossy surfaces, like the two cardboard sheets they provide, windows or each other. The child can try for representational images (i.e., faces), patterns or whatever they want. (I feel certain artists like Piet  Mondrian and Frank Stella would have loved Colorforms.)  No adult supervision is required, other than keeping the kids from hogging all of one color or shape. And, depending on their mood, it can keep children occupied for some time.  All in all, a lot of fun for kids and grownups. Gotta enforce the rule that they play with the Colorforms in one place and not carry them around the house, though. Things are murderous to pick up when they're spread out.  Overall, a fun, durable toy that provides many hours of fun to the young ones - and the old ones, as well.Jerry [SEP]"",""[CLS] If you are creative and have a child whom you love, this is an ideal toy!  The shapes allow one to create numerous pictures, the colors are bright, and the book in which the pieces are housed makes an ideal carrying case.I purchased this for my daughter's niece who is four years old and very active.  She rarely sits still and, like many children today, is more enthralled by video games and movies than creative playthings.  However, when I sat down to play Colorforms with her, we created things for over an hour without her losing interest. I do not think she will  play with this toy alone as she is not spatially oriented or someone who thinks creatively.This toy is best for someone who is more design oriented or for parents/grandparents to engage with a child in a play activity.The pieces are originally in sheet form and attached to individual pages in the storage book.  One must peel them carefully to avoid losing pieces which have not been fully cut in the manufacturing process.  The scrap has many large sections that can be used to cut additional shapes - hearts, leaves, etc. to provide additional flexibility of design.  We had no difficulty with the pieces sticking to the two boards provided for designing, and were also able to stick them on windows and the refrigerator.One warning, I was the only adult in a group of six (one 60, three 50-somethings, and two parents in their 20's) who had ever heard of or played with Colorforms.  If you have any doubts, you might want to be sure someone knows what to do with this wonderfully creative toy. [SEP]"",""[CLS] WOW, it is SO cool that they brought these back! Colorforms are one of the few toys from my childhood (a long time ago :-) that I can remember playing with all the time. See these also brought back memories of the commercial and it's tag line, Its Colorform Fun!. What a trip!OK, on to my review:We have a set to keep kids busy while parents shop in our small store.The set contains 350 Colorform shapes, in a spiral bound book, and two boards to position them on. The pieces are made out of a vinyl like material, so they are very soft and will cling to other surfaces as well.We found that 5 to 8 year olds really enjoyed these and even kids up to 12 or so showed some interest, which was a surprise to us as the older kids are mostly into electronic games. The best reactions always come from the adults who see these and almost always say, Oh, I remember thoseThe pieces are durable, colorful, and stick just fine to the included boards and each other. This allows for the creation of almost any shapes and patterns. It is important to make sure the pieces are returned back to their original sheets when kids are done playing with them to keep them from getting bent or lost and the spiral bound book makes this convenient.This toy brings out the creative side of children and most will have hours of fun creating abstract works of art. We are occasionally surprised by the kids who use overlapping shapes to make realistic works, like cars, faces, houses, etc.Highly recommended! [SEP]","[CLS] The award-winning kit that started it all. The Retro Original Colorforms Set is just like the set that launched our brand in 1951. In the set is 350 brightly-colored geometric stick-ons in 5 different colors with a reversible 2-sided play board. It all comes in an elegant spiral bound book, with a presentation case that features the history of Colorforms.

There is nothing like helping your child out only to find that materials provided are green food coloring and gelatin, but the materials that you need to have are a pan, microwave safe bowl, magic glitter, half of the bathroom, and RV, and the upper half of the state of California. I am exaggerating of course, but if this kit is to be useful as the kit it is stated to be shouldn't it have everything that is needed except for maybe a pan or the microwave?My daughter loves it, but I was highly disappointed that I paid this much for....well, $2 of materials that can be obtained at almost any store, and a set of instructions that I can look up online for free.Here, let me sell you dehydrated water and the instructions to hydrate it.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] Great doll tent [SEP]"",""[CLS] So cute...great for barbie or dolls [SEP]"",""[CLS] Very cute [SEP]"",""[CLS] This car is so cute.  I love the plastic moving wheels.  The previous versions had stuffed wheels.  The plastic are way better in my opinion.  The car fits two groovy girls nicely...or would fit other dolls like maybe barbies or various 12 inch and smaller.  I'm sure my daughter will squeeze small stuffed animals into it!  There are cute seat belts and other adorable touches.  I admit that groovy girls are kind of flopsy seated in the car.  They lay back kind of far unless you can really get their legs smooched down into the seat.  I think it's fine though.  My daughter didn't seem to care when we were playing with it in the store.  She is 5 1/2 and needed some help getting the girls in completely.  More so when there are two in the car.  One is easier to manage for her.  I purchased this in a local store since no one online really has it now.  I did contact Manhattan Toy and they said it will be back in stock at the end of July 2014....at least on their website anyway.  I wanted it as a gift so went ahead and got it very early from the store since I was not sure if I'd be able to find it in time later.  Super cute.  I find it to be a little pricey for what it is but I feel good about putting that money toward groovy girls rather than Barbies or some cheap plastic toy.  Groovy girls are wholesome and fun.  If I can keep my daughter interested in them that makes me happy!  I see they have a groovy girl dollhouse now too.  I think expanding this line is a great idea!

It's totally understandable why it's so special.My 4 granddaughters & their friends have been sharing a lot better now, however it's always a big deal for the girls to race up to the playroom to get to this before the others.  A couple times, I had to hide this in my library when sharing wasn't happening.  Since they're behaving better, I'm going to surprise them with another one in the collection.

B000BXM81K,"[CLS] For one I have to say to all you negative nancies about the dig kits of any kind being messy, dusty and dirty, well duh. It is to be close to real life digs. Second then yu complain about the kits lasting an hour or two. Well here's the deal. If your child loved doing it that hour or two will stick with him forever. Also they are small bricks how long are they supposed to last? My word.So onto my review. You can see almost step by step how the kit went. It was a lot of fun and my son and i did it together. He was more than happy to do it with me. The excavating took just over an hour to complete and get all of the pieces out. To get him cleaned up and built took another 30 mins or so. Took almost two hours from start to finish. My son loved this kit and was so happy to put him together. Sadly he did say it was better than the gem kits now. I love the gem kits. I had a lot of fun digging this guy out as well.We did this kit on my bed on top of a towel. Yes the kit makes a lot of dust when you use paint brush or blow it off, but thats part of the deal. Its not liek it cant be cleaned up. I highly recommend this kit to any dinosaur.mammoth lover. It was tons of fun. [SEP]"",""[CLS] 11 year old grand daughter loves this.  Her brother has the dino ones, so this was a good alternative. [SEP]"",""[CLS] WOW LOVE THESE THINGS. GREAT FUN [SEP]"",""[CLS] (I will refer to GeoWorld as GW and Dig a Dino as DD)Shortly after his birthday a couple of months ago, my son took an interest in dinosaurs. We went to a store and found a GW T-Rex excavation kit.  He enjoyed the kit so much that we bought more excavation kits.  As time went on, his interest became more of an obsession and he's excavated many a dinosaur from both the GW brand and the DD brand.The following dinosaurs have been excavated...GW brand: T-Rex, Brachiosaurus, and Elasmosaurus.DD brand: T-Rex, Stegosaurus, Triceratops, Pterosaur and Woolly Mammoth.Each of these brands has their own positives and negatives and if you are deciding between the two, I hope my review will be helpful. I would give each brand a 4 star rating.Comparisons:1. Tools: -GW comes with a hammer-like tool and chisel.  DD comes with a rounded hammer-like tool and a paintbrush (See my photo here&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Geoworld-Dino-Excavation-Kit-T-Rex-Skeleton/dp/B004DSO4KM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Geoworld Dino Excavation Kit - T-Rex Skeleton</a>&nbsp;).  The GW tools work just fine on the GW clay.-The DD tool doesn't work well on its own.  In fact, I have no idea how to break the clay with the single tool provided. I would suggest supplementing with a toy hammer.  We use a Black&Decker toy hammer which has worked great.2. Clay:-The GW clay comes in several colors depending on whether the dinosaur lived on land or water.  (We haven't tried any flying dinosaurs from this brand - YET).  The walking dinosaurs have cream colored clay and the elasmosaurus has blue clay.  The clay breaks apart easily and is perfect for young kids. It took my son 2 hours the first time and now it takes him only an hour to excavate.-The DD clay is pink and has a more rock-like harder texture.  You have to bang pretty hard on it but it does break.  It takes my son at least two hours to excavate with this clay.  Usually, he asks me to help him chip away at it.  Again, this is why the tool provided is useless without a hammer.  My son and I have used the GW tools on this clay and they work but we both prefer using the hammer with one of the tools.-Washing the clay off of the dinosaur is a bit easier with the GW clay because it seems to wash away more easily.  For tough to wash spots, I like to use an unraveled paper clip to push the clay out of tiny spaces.3. Dinosaurs:GW dinosaurs look like smaller replicas of the real thing and are pretty impressive.  The bones are hard and painted in various tones to look like real bones.  The pieces usually snap together well and when the dinosaur is put together, it stands up well too.  I would recommend this brand to someone who intends to DISPLAY their dinosaurs.  Since the bones are hard, they can break if they are played with. In fact, our first T-Rex broke when my son tried to pull a leg out of its socket.  The connector on the leg snapped when he tried to do this.  Luckily, the store was nice enough to give us a replacement.  These skeletons are not really meant to be taken apart and put back together.  We have them displayed and once in a while, my son asks to hold one.  He knows he needs to be extremely careful when playing with one because it can snap.DD dinosaurs are more rubbery.  They come in a one-tone cream color and don't look anywhere near as authentic as the GW brand.  They can be a bit tougher to put together because of their rubbery nature and are a bit wobbly when you try to stand them up.  With that said, the rubbery material withstands PLAY really well.  When my son excavates them and tries to pull a bone that isn't coming out, I don't worry that he might break it.  I say be very careful a lot more when he's digging a GW dinosaur. He can play more roughly with the DD dinosaurs and take them apart and put them back together without worrying that something will snap.Size: GW dinosaurs are quite a bit bigger than DD dinosaurs (see photo)4. Recommended Age:GW is ages 6+ and DD is ages 8+.  I'm not sure why DD recommends a minimum so high.  It could be because the clay can be tough to break apart.  As mentioned earlier, with better tools, even a 5 year old can do it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Very messy but very fun! We played with outside on the deck, luckily. My son loved it.

B000C6YIT6,"[CLS] First off, I buy a lot of magnifying glasses. I have no less than 6 in my desk drawer right now. This is the latest to my collection and it's  more of a loupe than a magnifying glass. It's pretty small, much smaller than expected. The glass itself is 3 x 2, but it's very highly distorted around the edges . This is not good for reading. It is very good for examining a small area. About the size a quarter is perfect. The rest is very distorted. The light is very good, very bright and a wide pattern. It also uses a standard AAA battery. It also seems to be about 3x magnification.I also have the Carson which at first is similar to this, but very different in the details. The Carson is about 4 x 3 and much less distortion. It's about 2X magnification and the light is just okay and it uses some button batteries, which I don't like because they are expensive and a pain to keep in stock.  But it's better for reading than this one.I actually like both and use both. Both have folding handles and fit in any pocket.If you are buying to read, I'd use the Carson or something larger  (I have one of those coming as well) but if you are trying to see the details of an object, like coins, jewelry, or machined parts, etc, I think this one is better for that.

B000CELAN0,"[CLS] The brand of the weave loom I purchase is different but the contents is exactly the same. Rainbow color yarn balls and the wooden loom. I purchase it bcuz I am always looking to expand my crafting skills and enjoy trying new things. With winter around the corner I wanted to learn different ways of making a scarf for Christmas gifting besides knitting and crochet. So I bought this wooden loom. I must admit it's a bit pricey but sorta worth it. The instructions aren't very detailed but YouTube has loom weaving vids that help make instructions alot more clearer to understand. I had to knock one star off bcuz of that and the fact that the box states 75 yards of yarn but really it's only good for making one scarf. Good thing I have a large stock of yarn and also it's kinda difficult to make a scarf bcuz the length of your woven item is short so the way you make a scarf is to weave up to the top of the loom then sew several pieces together to make it into a scarf length. It's really tedious and this loom is probably best only to make potholders or small pouches but not scarves or anything of that sort. Overall I think it's an okay gift to purchase but keep in mind if the gift receiver doesn't have much patience or unable to sit for long periods this may not be the best gift as it's very time consuming and requires lots of patience sitting on your caboose.*EDIT : Also forgot to include that the needle is kinda useless.

B000CP7646,"[CLS] this thing is awesome [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a very different YO-YO in that it is basically 2 in one YO-YO's. It has a tiny switch that that engages the clutch and makes it operate as an auto-return when turned on ;and when switched off the it gives long spin times,excellent for string tricks. This 2-way operation makes this a fantastic choice ,especially for a beginner,or any player learning new tricks. Like all Yomega YO-YO's it is made of excellent parts,including the sturdy plastic sides and well designed and constructed clutch mechanism..It is a take-apart YO-YO with a steel transaxle and a plastic bearing with a rubber 0-ring. It comes with an extra,top quality string and a bonus instructional trick book. This YO-YO will give long and excellent service,and won't break or fall apart like some cheaper ones. Mine is the reddish/orange in color,but it is shown gere in blue. So,why carry 2 YO-YO's when I will do? [SEP]"",""[CLS] Very good Yoyo, but best for beginners. The auto return function is amazing! Given what it does I would expect it to cost more! However once you start getting good at Yoyo, if you continue to advance, you're going to want a Yoyo that YOU are in control of, NOT an auto return one. This Yoyo actually fixes all that. It has a switch that allows you to turn the auto return off. I tested it, and I'll be darned the thing works! Unbelievable! So here's the lowdown; this is a very good beginners Yoyo. It has a good hand feel. It's just heavy enough, sleeps well, and seems to be durable. The switchable Auto-Return function is perfect for younger kids just learning Yoyo. If you get hooked, this will not be your only Yoyo.Well, I had my first 'incident' with this Yoyo. I gave it a throw into a long sleep and it made a crunching noise. Rather than examine the yoyo when it returned, I threw it again. It spun, unscrrewed itself, and one half of the yoyo went off across the floor. I found the pieces, and it looked like one was missing, but that was not the case. I put it back together, and it still works just fine. Still agood yoyo, and an example of what happens when engineering meets fun. Take care when it makes a weird sound! Don't blame the yoyo if it's telling you somethings wrong! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Yomega is one of the top brands in YoYo's. They make many different styles. Each style has advantages,depending on the skill of the player and the types of tricks one wants to learn and play. As with all Yomega YoYo's the quality is top notch and will give a lot of hours of enjoyment witth little fear of breaking. This model has a clutch that allows for automatic return,but there is also a switch that allows for the clutch to be negated and then it can give a very long sleep time,allowing for lots of time for doing string tricks. Because of this switch,it is almost like having two different YoYo's ,which makes it a great choice for a beginning or intermediate player.

I thought I would like the hedgehog better than the rabbit, but no the rabbit is really adorable.  He looks so much better in the plush than he does in the picture.  His fur is very soft and full.  His little whiskers stand out just like they are supposed to and are just the right amount.  His nose is pronounced as an addition, not flowing from the background fur.  Ears stand up very well and eyes are realistic (I think you can even see that in the picture).  His little tail is a different color and points up, just like a Jack Rabbit's should, not a round tail like bunnies.He is surprisingly easy to move on the finger, not at all stiff as you might think.  Very Cute.He's a Christmas present for my young granddaughter.  This is an amusing and different gift sure to give hours, if not days, of fun.  And he is so affordable.

My six year old loves playing go fish and we also use the cards to play memory with our three year old.  It is great for traveling. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The quality of this product is great. Heavy card stock for the cards and a nice solid box. The reason I don't like this particular set of go fish cards is because there are WAY TOO many variations of colors in this set for little kids. My 3 yr old knows his colors and likes go Fish, but when he is looking at his set of card, how is he supposed to play when the colors are buttercup, warm red, indigo?  There aren't the real primary colors, it's a lot of light red, dark red, light blue, dark blue.  I think this product would be perfect if they could have just chosen normal basic colors:  red, orange, yellow, blue, green, purple, brown, etc. Instead of a rainbow of all the in between colors that kids have a hard time verbalizing/labeling.

That's fine for older kids, but for younger ones, these cards are really nice. They are strong, sturdy, and there's not as many books as with a full deck of cards. Game play is fairly quick, so it's not annoying for adults (lol). If you have a child under 6 or 7, you should definitely get this deck.

The different races of the children have made for some educational discussions about diversity.

Only a couple dozen countries are included, but they run a wide swath of cultures -- Asian, African, European, South and North American, with differences accentuated by having most of the kids dressed in traditional clothes (instead of FuBu and Nike, which is what they probably really are all wearing... :-)The rules are simple, making this ideal for younger players, while the multi-ethnic parade of faces and exotic locales will stimulate the imagination. Plus, I'm a big fan of picturebook author Lizzie Rockwell's artwork, which is particularly appealing here. Recommended!

But this company has been making them with exceptional quality.  Each square is made of brick thick sturdy board.  No sharp edges and cut very uniform.  Using faces is also a great idea, I myself am pretty bad remembering faces and names, hopefully my kids will pick up more than just simply pairing them.  Discerning subtle differences on faces like hair, face shapes, eyes, noses, may help them to be more focused on details (and hopefully help them to remember real people faces).I usually don't care much about this kind of toys - I mean, if they lose pieces or damage, like a throw away or garage sale item for next year.  But the way it was made, it makes me want to take care of it more or pass it on to someone else.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] This puzzle is amazing. Great quality! My 4 year old LOVES it and it is one of his favorite toys he got for Christmas this year! He was immediately drawn to it and has played with it multiple times so far. He is fascinated by getting to see the inner parts of his body. However my husband pointed out an interesting point. It goes from surface layer (clothes) to deeper and deeper levels (skin, muscle, internal organs and skeleton) However, the skeleton (rib cage for example) protects the internal organs shown. So technically, that should have been the 4th layer and the organ systems printed on the bottom layer. So those 2 layers should be reversed, if they are going from surface layers to deepest layers... Made me think a bit. Just wanted to point that out. Its a 5 star product to me, either way! The only thing I was disappointed about, was that it was not made in America. (made in china) I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this is. Pieces fit well, it is the perfect size, not too big, not too small.. It is much nicer than expected, very glad I chose this.

Each of the four layers is 7 pieces (28 puzzle pieces-the 29th piece is the tray), and the pieces of the layers are not interchangeable, so a muscle piece would not fit in the skin layer.

WE also use our own unique game pieces, making it easier to spot each players property.It also gives us more than enough houses, hotelsand money so that we never run out. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I have several of these theme versions of monopoly.  I'm usually a bit hesitant about getting them but I'm a Family Guy fan and recently got to play this at a friend's house.  It's well designed enough that I think I'm going to ask for my own copy for Christmas! [SEP]"",""[CLS] If you are a hardcore Family Guy fan like me (I am actually one of the few people that watched Family Guy when it was originally on the air), you will not be disappointed with this Monopoly version. The box is beautifully designed with the Griffin family pictured on center, and some easter eggs to look around for. The board is not the most impressive one especially compared to The Simpson's and Muppets Monopoly versions but it is pretty nice with the Griffins at center. What you will love of the board is the properties, which include everything from Chris' Closet and Seamus' Lighthouse to James Woods High and Geronimo's Palace to The Clam and Channel 5 News to Mayor West's Mansion and finally Petoria, all from both old and new seasons plus some scenes from the Stewie's Untold Story movie. The property deeds are somewhat disappointing though. The do not have color watermarks like those found in the Simpson's version, but I guess they will do.Peter's Fishing Boat, Hinden-Peter, Peter-Copter and the Pope Mobile replace the Railroads. I bet you will not be laughing too much when you have to pay $200.00 (Income Tax) for Volcano Insurance or $75.00 for Workplace Sensitivity Training (Luxury Tax) but hey, you can't stay mad for long at the Salesman Guy, right? It would have been cool to have Joe Swanson on the Go To Jail space and have a picture of Quahog Prison on the jail space but well, what can you do?The Pewter Tokens are nice. You can chose from TV Junkie Peter, Mug in hand Brian, Nose picking Chris, Lois, Stewie in a high chair and Meg (who looks like a Peanut character). You can also order four more tokens that include The Giant Chicken, Quagmire, Joe and the Evil Monkey.The coolest changes are the Chance and Community Chest cards that are replaced by the What the Deuce! and Giggity! Giggity! Giggity! cards, respectively. They are beautifully done in full color and you will find things like; Made Sheriff of Bumblescum ADVANCE TO GO, Get Liposuction and Implants Pay $100, Confederate Civil War Veterans are After You Go Back 3 Spaces, Take Big Fat Paulie to The Movies as a Favor Collect $25.00, Help Death get a Girlfriend Collect $100, and many more.The money goes as follows $1 - Meg, $5 - Chris $10 - Lois, $20 - Brian, $50 - Stewie, $100 - Peter, $500 - The GriffinsThere are no special rules for this version, which is weird since it has been the norm for some time in these special Monopoly versions.To wrap it up I must say that even though they could have done a better job this is a beautiful and wonderfully done Monopoly game.

You will be amazed how much a good matt will cost you.  Previously the best value we had found (ECR3KIDS - ) cost about 30% more, so while this may seem expensive its really a good price.  Quality wise I think its as good as matt that cost twice as much.  Ive only had this about a month, so I cant say its as durable, but so far its held up well.  The build quality looks really good, and they are nice thick pads.The other thing we really like is that it has really tight transitions between the mats.  Some mats have gaps which create small divots.  If you have a kid who is unsteady on their feet those are just a pain.The star print is really fun and all of my kids really like it, boys and girls.  It just looks better than the typical solid color matt.  Overall this is a great product and a great value; I can recommend it without hesitation. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We do a lot of tumbling in this household and this felt like a great addition to have in the house.  I was pleased with the size and how well it folds up (we slide it under the kids bed when not in use).  My one complaint is that I thought it would be a little softer of a padding. It is quite hard and feels only slightly better than landing on the carpet.  For the kids though, the addition of a tumbling mat ups the fun. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This mat is a generous size and attractive with brightly colored circles and stars in a blue yellow and green color palette.  The only problem would be that this is far too firm for the kids to tumble on.  Ordinarily we use a mat for an extra seating area for kids watching movies or even as a nap mat but again, wouldn't recommend this for any of that because it's just too hard.  Fortunately I was able to find a use for the mat that does work for us and that is as a floor to our Pacific Play tent.  The colors coordinate and it fits well enough considering these items were not purchased with the intent of being used together.  The tent is used indoors as a fort and the mat does make it a little more comfy feeling and gives a cozy cute appearance.  If used for exercise I would limit to sit ups maybe hand stands but don't plan on having your kids do any somersaults with this mat. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I have 3 young grandsons and wood floors.

B000F3S09K,"[CLS] We bought this set for a Christmas present for my 2 year old son. It's his favorite part of his new kitchen set, he especially loves the strainer, wooden spoon and whisk. I originally thought they were way too small but once we assembled the play kitchen, everything fits perfectly and is just right for him. One of the utensils (the pasta spoon) was broken when we opened the package, which was a bummer. The handle wasn't attached properly and a piece of the metal was sticking out, needless to say that piece was thrown away, which was fine because the edges of this piece were pretty sharp. I won't be surprised to see the handles coming off of all the pieces as they are pretty poorly attached, but for how much he enjoys it I'll just inspect them every so often and dispose as needed. We will probably want a little bit bigger set when he's a little bit older anyway so this buys some time.Side note: We also ordered the melissa and doug four food groups set and the beef patty fits perfectly in the frying pan.

We're probably saving this one for travel.  It isn't worthwhile to return it due to the hassle and the cost of return shipping.The larger sets (the ones with the coloring pencils) are a MUCH better buy.

Detailed enough to be realistic without being so detailed that the features bleed together when stamping.  Our ink pad was completely dried out though.

Just be forewarned that you may have a disappointed child if you don't have an extra ink pad laying around.

Most reviewers who were diappointed indicated that the size was too small. But the description is accurate: this stamp kit is 4 by 6 inches. That should give you an idea of the size of each stamp.

He's not into coloring the pictures in yet, just lots of enthusiastic stamping, counting, making animal sounds, and naming the animals and colors, which this is great for.  I do think that if your child wants to color the pictures in, you'll want the bigger stampers.  But this set is so cute, easy to store, and the 4-color stamp pad is nice.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] We have had these for about a year and they are wonderful! We read one about 3-5 nights a week and the kids really enjoy them. The only complaint I'd have would be that some of the questions are too hard for our 7 and 5 year olds. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I have four daughters, currently aged 8, 6, 4, and 2. And, despite their proclivity for all things princess, dinner conversation often has turned to age-typical coarse joking (revolving mostly around body parts or functions). Now, dad's no stranger to body humor, but I'd like to instill some sense of social decorum in my little angels and to aid the older ones in being better role models for their younger, impressionable siblings. This set of cards was just what I was looking for. The day we got them, we opened it and went around answering the first two or three questions. After that, and for the past month or so, one of them is quick to remind mom or me to break out the question box!Some of the questions provide longer and more thoughtful conversation than others. And we've found that some are better skipped until their older or reworded to fit their life experience (short as it is). The box is very solidly built and the laminated cards are only out of the box for a minute, so I expect that the set will last physically for a long, long time. And by the time we rotate through the cards, our kids will probably have forgotten the questions at the beginning...or will have changed their answers. So this dinnertime game should be a hit for many meals to come. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I got this for a friend who has a very shy little boy who doesn't like to talk much, even to family.  I came across this and figured I'd get it just in case they found it helpful.  They've been using it for a few weeks and she has been thrilled with the results!  Not every card inspires tons of conversation but they all get him to interact a little more and it encourages him to speak his mind.  So glad I found it!  Hearing about the improvement in his communication level is worth way more than what I paid!  The box is nice too so it can be left out on the table.

It makes kids think about things they may not normally think about and gives parents a peek into their child's brain.  It is interesting to hear some of the responses my son comes up with.  It is also a convenient way to give your child a topic to write about for an essay or in a journal.  If they write about it, you can hold onto it and look back years from now and get a good laugh or cry.  A little bit expensive, but the plastic case is extremely sturdy and makes it look nice if you keep it at the dining table.  Also a good conversation starter with your spouse or an small friendly gathering.  A simple idea with a lot of uses! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I was disappointed in the topics of the cards.  I hesitate to write this review because apparently many people loved this product.  I guess I was hoping for topics that we already didn't discuss and that would open dialog more.  It is great that you can randomly just pick a card and talk about it though so it isn't a total waste.  I think if it were a little cheaper I would be happier as I would feel that it was worth the price even if we only used it occasionally.A great way to use this is in the car on long drives.

They are made of plastic and of course could be broken but they were thoughtfully designed and are reasonably durable.  The mirrors on the Mack dump truck are probably the weakest item, but if they were to break off the truck would be otherwise functional.  Toys break.  We took this as an opportunity to try to help our three year old grandson understand that a little care was required if he wanted these to last and he's responded well.  So far, nothing's broken on any of them, despite hours of use.These all have so much intriguing detail that the kids are immediately drawn to them.  We have about a hundred buckeye nuts for them to push around and load without making a difficult mess.  They all have moving parts that allow them to perform their real world functions.  There are detents built in to hold position, so for example with the bulldozer, backhoe and front loader, the blades can be fixed and held in several different positions.As far as toys go, these are a little pricey but even a three year old understands from the detail that these are different that the coarser, simpler $5 - $10 equivalents.

I know it's tempting to buy the VERY expensive sets, but please...give these a try first.  There has YET to be a dent or chip in these blocks, and they've been through a lot.  They are LARGE, heavy, and very well made.  Smooth surface, no rough edges.I really like this architectural unit.  It adds a lot of character and opens up new building possibilities.  My children are 3 and 5, and these are used frequently.  It's amazing to watch them create their own structures and incorporate them into their other modes of play.  They've been turned into princess castles, car garages, ramps, race tracks, just plain old wonderful houses.Save that $$ and invest in these, instead.  They'll last a VERY long time. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I never worry when I'm purchasing Melissa and Doug merchandise!  This is a great collection of specialized shapes that makes the other Melissa and Doug sets we have LOTS more fun.  The older kids especially love them, and the wider range of buildings they can make with them. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Melissa and Doug's unit blocks (Large ones) are the best blocks I've ever seen.  I purchased 2 basic sets when my grandson was 2.  He is 5 now and I bought this one with the cool pillars and stairs so I could play with it before he gets to old for blocks.  All these Melissa and Doug blocks have been used countless times - for roads and buildings when he was in his truck stage, to make zoos when he was in his animal stage, and to make towers to knock down again and again in between. They never break or chip, and the size and heft of them makes them steady for building. Every kid should have a large set of wooden blocks, and Melissa and Doug's are the best. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Very well crafted blocks with classical styling.  An instant success to little boys who want to build & little girls who want to build homes for their beanie babies. I should probably buy another set since all the blocks are always used & more blocks are always wanted to continue their imaginary town.  Highly recommend these blocks. [SEP]"",""[CLS] These blocks, made of rubber wood, are great fun as long as the scale of the structures is kept small.  In combination with heavier quality maple blocks (Barclay wood blocks), I find that the lack of precision in the machining of the M&D blocks leads to a bit of instability, e.g. 4 architectural columns placed together does not form a solid even surface for something to be placed on top.  Whereas 4 maple cylindrical blocks on the exact same surface provided a solid even surface for taller structures.  Anyways, the M&D blocks are still fun, an inexpensive option, and a clever kid can probably work around the limitations. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The grandparents purchased this set of blocks for my two girls (1 & 3) and it has been a phenomenal hit.  At first I recommended against the purchase -- it was expensive and we already have a glut of toys.  I figured these blocks would just collect dust.  Was I wrong.My older daughter loves constructing with these blocks and plays with them almost every day.  Block time has become a ritual every evening before bed.  What I enjoy is watching her incorporate so many of her other toys into her structures -- little princess toys, my old Star Wars action figures, elements of her dollhouse.  And they are super durable -- our youngest throws them around and there aren't any dings or, worse, splintering.There are a few pics of nice finished projects on the case label that are real easy to duplicate and even easier to riff on.  I'm often surprised to see intriguing, multifaceted designs emerge rather than a mere single tower that topples.There are enough pieces to make this set worthy as a stand-alone but I might even purchase another and get monumental. [SEP]","[CLS] Design an architectural masterpiece with this set of forty-four hand-scrolled and turned wooden blocks in eleven different shapes. This natural finish, smooth-sanded hardwood block set is packaged in a handsome, wooden storage crate for easy storage. Great value!

B000GHVLLO,"[CLS] Another great MindWare toy!  I bought this for my younger son, and the Blik Bloks for my older son.  They are learning the same concepts, although at an appropriate individual speed.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] They have held up at our after school program! [SEP]"",""[CLS] These are really nice blocks.  I like them because they are not too small which could pose a hazard to the little ones.  They are bright colored and fun to build with.  This box also comes with a number of cards that are in three stages, beginners, intermediate and advanced.  I think this will be a good toy to have around for many years.  It's fun for all ages and you can't say that about very many toys. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I was recommended by a educator. However, when my 4 year-old finished all the puzzles at the time she got it, and never wanted to touch it again. For the money, she played only once, it's kind of a wast of money. She found the game has no challege. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 3 year old got these for Christmas and he loves them and so do I. The blocks are fairly large, bright vibrant colors and heavy and well constructed. They have kept him entertained for hours and he begs to play with them. I noticed on several reviews for MindWare products that people were complaining about the cards showing an orange color when the corresponding block was red and that's true but my little boy didn't seem to notice it at all. It in no way hinders his ability to play with this. My only wish is that you could order an expansion pack. He has completed the easier cards over and over again. I will definitely be purchasing the MindWare imaginets set for him now because it does have more pieces and chances to expand. For now though I'm incredibly pleased with my purchase and love the blocks this set came with. I would buy again and probably will buy again for a gift for my niece and nephew.I'm editing this post to let you know that here we are over 4 years past my original post and these are still a hit. They were purchased for my 3 year old in 2013 so he's 7 now and he still does these now and then.  I also have a 6 year old girl,  a 3 year old boy and a 3 month old boy. My 3 year old now begs to play with them and since they are still in great shape, they will survive for my baby to play with some day.  That will be 4 kids that got to use them. Buy them! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My son gave this to his best friend for Christmas, and he loves it.  He is 3 1/2 years old, and his mother told me he plays with it often. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I use this in therapy a lot and the kids like it.  Great for learning to spatially orient pieces and making a 3D model from a 2D model.  The cards go from easy to difficult, so it can be graded for difficulty over time.  The models are fun and appeal to kids, the colors are bright.  The cards are coded with colored borders so it is easy to tell which ones are easy, medium, hard, etc. without having to look at the picture.  A variety of shapes adds to the challenge. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The cards that come with this toy show the examples to make very small, they are not large enough to set the blocks on, just a visual model. My autistic 4 year old uses these within his ABA program to learn black building. He loves them and is getting pretty good at copying. Great quality [SEP]"",""[CLS] I thought this looked like a cool toy and it had some great reviews, but my 4 year old daughter is just not a bit interested.  She loves puzzles and building things with blocks and magna-tiles and is pretty smart for her age, but she just doesn't find this toy appealing.  I'm disappointed and hope she'll maybe grow into it.  It is durable and educational and does everything is says on the box, but she gets bored with it after just a few minutes.  No doubt it will work for others but this was a waste of money for us.***UPDATE***  Now a year and a half later and this has really never been played with.  Just shows that however good reviews are, all kids are different and respond differently to things. [SEP]","[CLS] Help a child take block building to a whole new level.

B000GJ5GMW,"[CLS] I bought this set for Arctic/Antarctic sorting as well as for use in a polar/winter sensory bin.First off, the photo image is wrong.  There are no Eskimos included in the set - only the igloo (which is pointless if there are no people to live in it).Second, most of these sets are 12 pieces, so there is no reason why this set only has 10 pieces.Third, the set does not include arctic birds, ermine, or narwhal.  I strongly suggest the manufacturer remove the igloo (since there are no Eskimos) and instead include an arctic bird (like a snowy owl, puffin, or snow goose).  Plus add in a narwhal and an ermine to make the set 12 pieces.Lastly, the paint job on my beluga was terrible - it looks like it was in a fight and is bleeding from its mouth and has wounds on its back.  The orca has matching peachy paint on his fins so maybe the beluga bit him in a battle.  Not exactly the happy beluga image you may want your 3-year old's sensory bin.Overall, I want to like this product, but the reasons above caused the product to drop from a 5 to 3 star rating.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] I came across these searching for something else & absolutely LOVE THEM!!!!These are the PERFECT size for toddler hands.  I only purchase toys that are not made w/ harmful things & am so happy these are not made w/ anything bad.They are very cute.  I sometimes get tired of figurines being cartoon like or an actual character.  These are simply the real thing.  They depict what they actually are & that is great!These were originally purchased to take in the car & not be heartbroken if lost/etc.  However, these are played with everyday.  I would say any child above 2 would enjoy these.  Some of them are a bit small so be very careful, but they are very cute & educational.Only one con - the rabbit is very hard to keep standing up & that can be frustrating.  However, I would still buy this set & it is not that big of a deal - just wanted to give the feedback so you'd be expecting it.  Everything else stands up great.I have already bought several of the others & highly recommend them all.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] My toddler loves this board.  He enjoys playing with both the ABC and 123 magnets that it comes with.  He isn't ready for the dry erase side just yet but it will be perfect in 6 months when he turns 2. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Nice board for toddlers. It has two side: magnetic blackboard and white board. My eighteen months old daughter uses the blackboard for the magnets. I also git her animals magnets. The whiteboard is too early to be used by her. The blackboard is fun for her buy I had to take the chalks since she started eating them! Overall, it's nice to get it and the quality is also good. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My two year old daughter (like most toddlers) is a very hands on learner and just is beginning to show interest in the alphabet. We found this board with magnets at a local discount outlet and it has quickly become one of her favorite toys!She enjoys playing with and talking about the magnetic letters and numbers, as well as drawing on both sides. If you purchase this for a young child, I recommend buying dry erase crayons and extra magnets to extend the play value.My only complaint is that the quality of the magnets is disappointing coming from a company as trusted as Melissa and Doug. She's had this four days, has not been very rough with it at all, and already a few of the letters are peeling away from the magnet backing. We're planning on purchasing plastic letter magnets that will hopefully last longer. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We bought this for our daughter's second birthday.  Here's what we like and don't like.Pros:1. We like the magnetic side.  We bought some of the melissa and doug magnetics in a box sets to use- our daughter loves to play with the magnetic animals.  It's one of her favorite afternoon activities.  The magnetic letters that come with it will be used as she gets older.2. Chalk side- she's had fun with this too.  The chalk that comes with it is tiny and breaks so I went and bought some super large, chunky chalk and it is much better.  She enjoys coloring, using a wet rag to wipe it off and start over.3. Size- I like that it is on the smaller side.  It's the perfect size to take with us when we go to a restaurant, car ride, etc.4. We haven't used the dry erase side yet- she is to young for markers.5. We like the little string that you can use to hang this board up.  Our daughter has a child size table and chair set in the kitchen and we hung this chalk board/dry erase board up above the table.  She loves to pull it down and play with it while I'm making dinner but it also looks really cute hanging on the wall above her table.CONS:1. Chalk is very skinny, small, cheap, breakable.  You almost have to go out and buy some of the larger pieces of chalk to use that are more sturdy.2. No ledge to put the chalk.3. The eraser that comes with it is only for the dry erase board.  It doesn't work on the chalk side so you also have to go out and buy a little chalk eraser.  They aren't expensive but still, it's aggravating to have to go out and get it.4. It would be nice if there were...a. more dry erase colorsb. if the dry erase markers were washable.  Our 2 year old is to young to be careful with markers so she can't use them yet b/c they aren't washable.Overall, this was a good purchase and we would buy it again.  Our daughter very much enjoys playing with the magnetic/chalk side and will grow into the dry erase side as she gets older.

B000GPWNWM,"[CLS] This is the third item that I did purchase from the Diamond Select line of old Star Trek replicas.My first Phaser was a medical (white handle) one, and that was garbage; not sure if it was defective or it if came like that from the factory, as bad design, but it was hard to even put together, and many features were not working as expected.This one seems much better; rotating the ring around the nozzle, change the brightness of the laser effect on the transparent part of the phaser; the wheel on the back of the unit enable the overloading, and the plug to connect the Type1 phaser to the Type2 is working as expected.In case you do not know, the phaser here is the type 2; which is more powerful. The small black unit on the top, is the type 1, which is less powerful. you can detach it from the type 2 and use it on its own, or mount it on the type 2 phaser for a stronger weapon.The phaser has 5 settings, which you can select using the wheel on the top; the other wheel raise a bit the screen, to simulate some sort of aiming system, but just let it be; because it lift not even an inch the center part of the phaser, and really there is not much difference, but it feel like it may break easily.When on its own, the type 1 has a button on the bottom, that is very small and is not easy to notice, this is what you use to fire; and a red beam with the appropriate sound will play.When on the type 2, the phaser has a trigger on the bottom, which is very clear to see, being silver and being where you would expect to find a trigger; the red beam is channeled through the transparent rod in the nozzle, and that will turn red when you will fire it. Other than that, type 2 is just a handle where to put type 1 phaser, and has no other use.The wheel in the back is used for the overload feature, but all that it does is to press a inner switch, so when you use the trigger, instead of the usual sound, you will hear the overload sound.In the end, it is decently made; I would prefer something more premium, but of better quality; since this is basically all plastic. But can't really deny that it is a great replica of the show prop [SEP]"",""[CLS] For a Star Trek fan, this is a must.

Apparently, Amazon also hates me to give a one-star review, too, as this is the third time I have tried to publish this 1-star review.The board and playing pieces are exactly the same size and shape as the original version of Traffic Jam, but in the Deluxe version, the playing pieces have a metallic paint on them that chips off.Also, in the original version, there is a little drawer beneath the playing board used for storing the cards, unlike the Deluxe version which has no storage drawer.The original version comes with a carrying case, and the cards, board, and playing pieces all fit neatly into it.  The deluxe version is not similarly portable, and the game board, cards, and playing pieces are stored in the flocked plastic molded insert inside the box.So, while the game itself is still fun, challenging, and totally addictive, this Deluxe version is a real stinker when compared to the original!

To our pleasant surprise, these are wonderful.  They are perfect for toddlers.  They fit in their hands just right & the best part is these look like the actual animals.  They are not chartoons or a certain character.  So many toys are not real & these are as real as you'll find.The only caution is some of the pieces are somewhat small (not many but there are a couple per tube).  Be sure to take caution especially if your child puts things in their mouths.It is so cute to see them line up all these little animals.  I see a lot of imaginery play in the future w/ these.We will not take these in the car as initially intended as they are played with everyday inside.  They have been played w/ daily so that deserves positive feedback.  Worth every penny!And, all the tubes are great.  We've bought several of them.  We've bought both the Safari & Wildlife series (these are the 2 main name brands for the tubes).

Highly recommended, it's just not at the top of my list when looking at all the different Toob sets. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bough this set to use in continent sorting and most of these animals were perfect for South America.First off, the photo image is wrong. There is no human explorer included in the set - only South American animals.Second, most of these TOOB sets are 12 pieces, so there is no reason why this set only has 11 pieces.Third, the set does not include a sloth, capybara, pink river dolphin, or piranha, but contains two frogs.  The set does not need duplicate animals (even if they are different colors).  I suggest that the manufacturer remove the red-eyed tree frog and add in any two of the aforementioned species to make the set 12 total pieces with no duplicated animals.Lastly, is paint/design.  The iguana is not well executed.  It looks more like an eel with legs than a lizard.  The jaguar's spots are faint/faded on one side and I am going to put it in Asia as a clouded leopard.  There is no blue ring around the toucan's eyes (as there should be for this species).  The macaw's eyes are two different sizes.Here is what I got in the set (which minor differences from the listing description): giant anteater, blue and gold macaw, red eyed tree frog, red and black striped poison dart frog, black caiman, emerald tree boa, toco toucan, green iguana, spider monkey (which has an orange coat so looks almost like a golden lion tamarin), tapir, and a yellow/orange jaguar (or you could use it as a clouded leopard).Overall, I want to like this product, but the reasons above caused the product to drop from a 5 to 4 to a 3 star rating.  if the painting had been better, I would have given it 4 stars.

We instead bought a bunch of the Calico Critters sets because you get a lot more for your money and they seem a little sturdier.  The kids don't care either way.  The only complaint that I have about the house is that the floors are very deep.  It is difficult to play with stuff on the inside back wall of the house.

I have purchased a lot of their play sets and have never experienced breakage or any other problem with their toys.The  scale of this set makes it difficult to find compatible accessories, but my granddaughter has a collection of Madame Alexander fairy tale dolls from McDonalds that she plays with and the size difference doesn't seem to matter to her.

B000GYSYTE,"[CLS] What a delightful collection.  And I expect a lot from Melissa and Doug.The table pieces are adorable.  There is spindle work and detailing.  The tops are not just flat.The couch and chair material is a red-ish wine color with off-white and greenish-gold stripes.  The pillows are sewn on and plush.  The front of the sitting pieces, seats, and backs have padding.  There are little feet which holds the furniture off the ground.The curio cabinet has doors that open!  and plastic shelves and back.  It's nicely made and even has little knobs.These pieces come in a nice box with each piece in it's own plastic compartment.SUMMARYThis is a really nice collection that has adorable detailing.  I will say though that these are NOT pieces for Littles.  They are detailed and wood and to get the detail you have to give up the sturdiness.  (Items like the pillows, if pulled off, could be choking hazards and if someone broke the plastic shelves I imagine they could poke/cut themselves.)This would be fine for an older child who is 'mature' enough to be able to care and play with nice doll-house furniture.  We purchased this for our teen's crime scene project and couldn't be happier. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We have a number of Melissa & Doug dollhouse sets and love them all--great quality and detail.

It looks great and the workmanship is very detailed.  It really looks like real furniture.  The problem is that it is very delicate.  The leg broke off of the Curio Cabinet pretty quickly during normal play.  I would say this set is more for a doll house that is going to be more of a museum piece that isn't going to get played with every day.  These will not last during normal play conditions.  We instead purchased several Calico Critters sets that are much more sturdy and have a lot more accessories.  Sure they don't look as nice, but they will last a lot longer during normal playtime.

B000GYSZDO,"[CLS] I Like the Safari LTD Toobs.  We had borrowed one for our Play School of 3-4 year olds last year (Arctic) and invented many circle time activities with it. The children are so proud of themselves learning all the animals names.  We adapt songs, and games to play centered around the animals.  This year we added the North American Animals and will be adding a few more as budget allows.  They are a good size to add to our train table scenes throughout the year. One of our favorite games with Arctic was to pass around a mitten as each child put in their figure and we sang a song  The Arctic Fox goes in the mittenetc. We also used them in our Mystery Box.  As we passed a box around and sang What is in the Mystery Box each child pulled an animal outWe then went around and asked them what they had and learned a bit about each animalso many possibilities with these. The value of these for the quality and amount of play we get from them is high. For the North American Animals, I will have to think what we can pull them out off, as the Mitten was for the cold I have some small green burlap bags that I could simply draw tree outlines on I cannot wait to start using these.  As a note we don't concern ourselves so much with proper proportion size at ages 3-4the kids are paying attention to the animal and we talk about where they live, what they eat, what color they are, what kind of coat they haveso many thingsThey are not thinking about whether or not proportions are correctwe use other activities for size differences.

We save them for restaurants, etc. and he is always excited to see them.  I have already ordered their insect set and expect to order even more.  That is how much I like them and he loves them. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought these as teaching aids to help my kids learn about different animals. Concepts are so much easier for them to grasp if they can hold and play with the animals they're leaning about, rather than just reading about them in a book. The animals are well crafted, the pieces have been nicely painted and they're fairly detailed which helps them look more realistic. They also have their names on the underside in case you need help identifying what they are. Most of the pieces in this set stand up on their own fairly well, although some are a little wobbly.The only thing I find a little cumbersome is the tube itself. While it's great for storing, it's compact size and odd shape makes it difficult to get the animals in and out - the rope handle also seems to get in the way. Other than the somewhat troublesome tube, the animals in this set are great and I will definitely be buying more of these collections.

B000H11O7U,"[CLS] Right off the bat, I can let anyone interested in this, is that it's a larger than normal sized yo-yo, & has some decent weight to it. Almost 70 g weight. But I find it feels great in my throwing hand, and the two halves are nicely gripable making it easy to catch it if you're doing a trick sending it looping & flying around, or simply doing 'around the world'. It slips out of my hand a lot less. It's a responsive yo-yo, but it does sleep & very well too. How long depends on person. I put a picture of it next to my yomega brain, for comparison. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Sorry, I figure that's how LL Cool J would start a review.  This is a great yoyo.  The rubber sidewalls make it easy to walk the dog on wood floors (why I bought it).  The action is smooth and even. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Yo-yos are such personal things.  Everyone has there favorite or favorites, as the case maybe, and anyone thinking of purchasing one of these things is that the perfect yoyo, one that is absolutely universally accepted as the best simply has not been built and quite likely never will be.Now I personally love this particular model and it suits me and my need perfectly at this time.First, this yo-yo is a bit heavier and a bit larger than some you can purchase.  At my size, it is absolutely perfect.  The extra weight gives me much more control when doing tricks and I like the feel and balance of the thing. Secondly, I learned on a standard yo-yo years and years ago, the gap on those older models was much smaller...very narrow.  This model is wing shaped and the intake gap is quite wide making it much easier to do string tricks.There are some things to consider when purchasing this yo-yo though.  Since it is heavier and a bit bigger, it can indeed cause some pain and possible bruising to the small hand.  I personally would not recommend this one for the smaller child who is just starting out.Secondly, this yo-yo does have a ring of softer rubber around the edge.  This is good in that it makes it easier to catch and does soften the return blow somewhat.  On the other hand, this rubber makes it more difficult to do some of the tricks where the yo-yo must contact any surface.  If this thing is used on the sidewalk, there will be significant wear in a very short time which will throw its balance off a bit...depending on how much wear is involved. On yet the other hand, this one will not get all funky looking with cuts and chips if you abuse it a bit.  I practice on an all wood floor so really do not have a problem in this area.Third, because of the extra weight and the rpm's which can be generated and the force involved do be sure that you have extra strings available.  (This is something you should have anyway...a worn string is a very, very bad thing indeed!)I note that some folks have had problems with sleep time on this one.  Might I suggest you shorten your string just a bit?  I have had great times with this one and can average out at least 20 with no great strain.  Each and every person will normally have their own string length suited for them...that is why they sell them so long...you can cut them to the desired size, where as it is a bit difficult to add if the string is too short.I have bashed this yo-yo around pretty good in practice and have yet been able to break the thing...a rarity for me.  This thing can take quite a beating which is good for the beginner.The axel is pretty smooth (I have seen better, yet I have seen and used worse), and it has a good feel.This is a pretty good price being offered here.  Everyone should have more than one yo-yo in their arsenal (actually, the more the merrier), and this is a fun one to fool around with.  Yes, there are better yo-yos on the market, but you are going to pay a lot more for them.  This one is great for beginners and intermediates will find that it will meet all of their demands before the move on to bigger and better things.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks [SEP]"",""[CLS] I got this for my nephew and he loves it!

Kids can even extend the play value by bringing other toys into the fun; add cars to make a parking lot, use blocks to build a stadium, or set up other figures as spectators. Not only are our products fun and educational when used as a visual teaching aid by coaches and parents, they also make perfect cake toppers, decorations, and centerpieces for sports themed parties and tailgates.

It has passed the test of time.Highly Recommended! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Someone at work bought a yoyo and told me he could not get it to return, and could not even wind it. I asked him to show it to me. In a few seconds I got it wound, sleeping, walking the dog, rocking the cradle, looping etc. This renewed my interest in yoyo's. His was a Duncan Butterlfy, but I have since bought several Duncan Imperials (One of each color), and many many more of the more complicated bearing, trans-axial, clutch,  etc. yoyos. It all began with Duncan, and this is the one (originally made of wood)  that started it all. These are no longer Made in the USA, but they still work well. You should be able to do the basics with this yoyo. If you need a more complicated yoyo to do the simple tricks, then how good are you really?Some advice:Always buy extra string. It's not a question of if your yoyo string will break, but when. You want to be ready with  spare string when this happens, and not sitting around waiting for string to be delivered. String is a disposable commodity. Don't treat it like a collectible.Cut your yoyo to the proper length for the user. About 2 inches (4 cm) above the navel is good. So many people don't do this and then complain The yoyo is too long for my young child! Cutting the string to the proper length is right on the back of the Duncan Package. This means if you have multiple children of varying heights, they should each have their own yoyo, or all learn to use the shortest string (It's easier for a tlal person to use a short string, and dangerous for a short person to use a long string.) This goes for Daddy and Mommy too. [SEP]"",""[CLS] If you are going to be a yo-yo pro, this is not for you. OK for beginners, but not very good overall. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I know that Duncan used to be the gold standard....but their quality leaves much to be desired these days.  My son received one for his birthday recently and it was only a couple of weeks before it was completely useless.  These are not what they used to be.  Their quality is almost as low as dollar store or something like oriental trading...save yourself the hassle and get something better.  My son is currently using the yomega brain, it's perfect for him.  It's so much easier for a beginner and last a lot longer that it is more than worth the extra couple bucks. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The original classic Yo-Yo, it feels good in my hand, simple, basic, quiet stress relief. If you want to do tricks you probably want one of the Butterfly designs or one of the new designs with ball bearings and friction strips and counter weights, this is just a simple, inexpensive Yo-Yo. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Duncan makes the best yoyos, but its tough to get excited that the yoyo I bought does exactly what it should do.  Hubby and kids are big fans, so we are buying these fairly often. [SEP]"",""[CLS] It has been years since I owned our used a Duncan Imperial yoyo.  I was wondering through the local Wally World store the other day and spotted them hanging there on a rack in all their glory.  On a whim I bought three of them.  They were only three dollars each and I figured why not.Over the past week or so I have been giving them quite a workout, driving both my wife and dogs crazy; which truth be told is sort of half the fun of it.Now I have several yoyos stashed around the house that I play with, some good, some better and some great.  The intent of this review though is not to compare these yoyos as the prices of the ones I already own is significant.I found these Imperials to be just fine and dandy and they did the job they were suppose to do, which in reality is to provide an inexpensive pleasurable pastime for kids and big people, and to provide the initial yoyo exposure to see if the young ones actually take to the things before you lay out big bucks for a nicer one.I found that these yoyos performed all of the basic tricks quite well.  Gravity pull, the throw down, the sleeper, the forward pass, walking the dog, around the world and around the corner; all were a piece of cake.  I found that the sleep time to be adequate for all of these tricks.  Using all three of the yoyos; testing each I found the sleep time ranged from 10 seconds to a little under 15 seconds.  It must be remembered that the string needs to be unwound quite often, (The sleeping beauty or flying saucer is great for this as it does the job with the benefit of actually looking like a trick).Now keep in mind that while more advanced trick can be performed; tricks such as the dog bite, jump he dog thought the hoop, the monkey climb the tree, and the bank deposit, they are never-the-less more difficult unless you are quite experienced.  Always keep in mind that any trick is 99 percent user skill and 1 percent yoyo.  It is just easier to perform the trick with the higher tech yoyos.  Really though, it is all a matter of practice no matter what the yoyo type may be.Also keep in mind that this is a very, very inexpensive model and in no way should you expect it to even come close to performing like a high end Kuhn, or one of the high end Duncans.  In this area you sort of get what you pay for.  Spending three or four dollars on one of these things is quite different than dropping one hundred or more...it would be quite unfair to compare these different yoyos.This yoyo does have a narrow string gap and a fixed steep axel.  It is made of plastic and I have given it some pretty good bashes without it breaking.  The design is classic.  I might suggest that you pick this one up for the beginner and pick up one of the low end butterfly models at the same time.  Hey, we are not talking a lot of money here.I you find your kids like these wonderful things, then you might want to give the Duncan Bumblebee or Yomega Raider a try.  For the beginner I think I would stay way from the metal model until they get use to handling their yoyo as the metal ones; the high tech models with bearings and such spin at about 100 miles per hour and can bruise little hands quite easy.  I know for a fact that they can bruise and hurt old hands...trust me.And don't forget to buy plenty of extra strings!  Stings bread and just a couple of hours of intense practice can sometimes do them in.Anyway, this is a neat and very inexpensive toy and a great thing to fool around with and a great yoyo to get a kid started.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks [SEP]"",""[CLS] <div id=video-block-R37ON1J3AV4V98 class=a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block></div><input type=hidden name= value=https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1SgqhQT7eS.mp4 class=video-url><input type=hidden name= value=https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71NVeP10o4S.png class=video-slate-img-url>&nbsp;Duncan has been making excellent yoyos for years.

Having a child with chronic health issues make me so aware of the importance of children being able to pretend and work out issues when they face scary situations.

I remember one trip to the hospital with my daughter when she was going to have surgery, the nurse was using Barbie and Ken to help tell her what was going to happen.

She even takes it to the doctor and uses it on him as well! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Yesterday I saw this kit on Amazon and realized it was the best one available after reading the reviews for every other doctor kit on Amazon. However, I flat-out refused to pay this much for a plastic doctor kit. I found it one or two other places for the same price and began to loose hope. After a short time looking online I struck gold: I found it available in-store only at the big box retailer which has the red bulls-eye for its logo. It was less than half the price when you factor in the shipping charged by the seller here on Amazon. It appears that every store within a 25 mile radius around me has them on the shelves but you cannot order them online. So, if you like this kit and want it for your child for less than half what you'd pay to get it here, go to the website for the big box retailer with the red circles/bullseye for the logo and see if it's available at your local store. My daughter is two/27 months and the parts are big enough for her hands to manage easily without any choking hazard worries. The stethascope is actually very impressively built for a kids kit. It's a nice size -- big enough for older kids -- big enough for even an adult -- but still works for a toddler. It makes a heartbeat sound when you push the red button. The box is so large it could fit ten of these inside, which is a good thing because I can add items like gauze or bandaids or ace bandages to bulk out the kit, or add a white coat down the line, and it will all still fit in this box. The clamps to close the case are too tough for my toddler to shut alone right now but she'll grow into it. The set includes a thermometer, shot, blood pressure cuff, stethascope, scissors and tweezers, beeper, the tool used to check ears and a mirror kind of like the one the dentist uses, plus it comes with the carrying case.  Overall the set appears very well made. I only wish it had a hammer for checking reflexes. I'm very happy with this, especially since I paid half the price listed here.

B000HX1NBA,"[CLS] This is a great game, a lot of fun for a group of players.  The objective is to make it to the helipad to escape from the city, or to collect 25 zombies i believe (which means you have to kill 25 zombies).  We usually play it until we get to the helipad though as it is more fun.  Each player spends their turn placing a tile of a city where they like, and then they roll a die and move, either killing zombies, trying to collect ammo or health, etc.  This is a game in which people work together up until the end when it is a mad dash to the helipad.  great party game, and this set includes the base game, and a decent amount of zombies, though we usually end up running out of them faster than we would like.  I recommend this game, especially if you like the video game left for dead; this is basically the board game for it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] No, the three exclamation points are not a typo.  This game is yet another homage to classic zombie movies.  The goal is to either kill 25 zombies or make it to the helicopter.  A rush to the copter never works.  So the strategy comes in, do you help another player, or let him die and run by while the zombies are snacking on him?  The game has 10 expansions and multiple spin offs.  So a lot of re-playability.  Takes a love of zombies and that theme is done to death (pun intended) right now so not for everyone.  Fun game all the same though and worth playing. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The mechanics aren't just as good as can be for a zombie game.  The theme is great but it still has to be fun for you to play.  I recommend looking at other zombie type games.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] Zombies!!! is a very fun game with a lot of replay value since each game is going to be totally different. We gave this to my zombie loving teen son and have had a great time playing. This game can be played with 2 players, but is most fun with 3-6 players and a lot of table space to build the playing board.The game comes with the game board tiles, action cards, 2 dice, six charactor pieces, 50 male zombies and 50 female zombies.

Drawing and placing a tile to expand the map, which also has zombies and perhaps health and bullets to add2. Taking a movement turn, and fighting any zombies in your path3. Moving zombies at the end of your turn* Event cards can be played at any time (once per round) and the effects take place right away.This can be played as semi-cooperative, but very quickly turns competitive. The main goal is stay alive until the Helipad is found and one player makes it to the center if the card OR until one play gets 25 zombie kills. We have a house rule that eliminates the 25 kill win rule if the Helipad is in play (unless we are pressed for time).Games do tend to take a few hours to play, but it is never dull, especially as players are making a mad dash at the end.Highly Recommended!CFH [SEP]"",""[CLS] This game is so versatile! You can play following the rules [...]You can play it as an RPG [...]and so much more!

(why you would WANT that experience I won't ask) Then Zombies!! is the game for you.Players find themselves trapped in a complex trying to get to the heliport to escape, however your path is blocked by the living dead.  LOTS of them.  As in the movies they are slow and easy to kill, also like in the movies one Zombie isn't much trouble, but the seer volume makes it a challenge to make it to the end without being lunch.Like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Steve-Jackson-Games-Munchkin-Quest/dp/1556347677/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Steve Jackson Games Munchkin Quest</a>&nbsp;your map is built as you go along so you have to find your way around.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] I have been curiously addicted to this simple game since I bought the first edition used at a game auction a few years ago. I have since gone back to buy this Second edition new, and al lthe expansions plus multiple Zombies packs glowing and plain. This Wide Screen set is the first of the games that gets the ball rolling. I upgraded to it because it contains a larger, deeper box that can hold the tiles and cards from most of the expansions (not 4). Don't expect it to hold more than 200 Zombies with all those cards and tiles though!With very simple and easy to learn rules, the only complaint I have heard from people that have played the game is that it can get a little long to play, and indeed it can. Minimum game length is from 60 to 90 minutes, unless you cheat the helicopter into the middle of the tiles. I have seen game sessions go 2-3 hours, and heard of even longer ones at my local game store.I am an old school gamer and this length of game does not really bother me. After all, the point of playing a game is to spend time with your freinds...(and help zombies kill them if possible.) Still I often use the Helicopter tile in the midlde cheat for shorter games myself.But fair warning if you are expecting a collectible card game style sit down for a game and get up 5 minutes later, it ain't gonna happen! This is NOT a Magic the Gathering! This is a tabletop game in the style of the old Illuminati card game only much simpler to play.If you get bored of this starter game there are 8 expansios available for variety, all of which I own, and most of which I love. There is even a Humans!!! game where you get to play the zombies! Twilight Creations does a great job with these games, and I am a huge fan. Later this June (2009) they will be coming out with a Martians!!! 1950's sci-fi game and frankly I cannot wait.Give this game a try.

FUN FUN FUN! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I like this magnet set, but I was a little disappointed to open it and find two girl bears.  It could be a better toy with both gender bears and clothing. My boys enjoy playing with dress-up magnets and my 9 year old had many when he was a little younger.  The dress-up magnets are great for imaginative play, allowing children to decide what the bears can wear which can lead to independent decisions about their own clothing.The magnets are also great for storytelling play.I'm not opposed to my boys playing with gender specific toys, (we've owned Polly pockets, dollhouses, calico critters, etc...) but by having two girl bears to dress up really limits their identification with the toy. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My toddler is at that age where she does pretend play very well. We got another T.S. Shure product recently and she loved it. When given the chance to try out this magnetic Pocket Bear I jumped at the opportunity because not only does she like playing with dolls, but she also enjoys dressing them. This was a way to do both things and have fun while doing it.The set comes with 2 bears and lots of pieces to dress up. When they say they're magnetic they truly meant it. She dresses them in whatever style she wants, complete with top, bottom and shoes and they actually stay on when she holds her bear upside down. There are so many different pieces that allows her to be creative.The set comes in a wooden box used for storing the pieces when she's done playing and there's a clear plastic lid that slides on that keeps them in place. Its also light enough that she can take it with her if we decide to go visiting.I do recommend this set highly. It has kept my little one entertained for a few hours well and she never sits too long with a toy but this was a hit with her. Lot of clothing and styling options, great storage case, light and portable and lots of fun! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Such a fun item. My autistic 10 year old son loves it, and he doesn't like a lot of toys. I'm sure it's great for toddlers too. high quality and nice reusable tray. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This toy reminded me of the paper dolls I played with as a child (except, of course, the pieces come pre-cut). It is rated for ages 3 and over and, since some of the pieces are small enough to fit through a toilet paper roll, it is a valid concern. Nevertheless, I play with it with my 2-year old granddaughter, who really enjoys it. She loves clothes, shoes, dressing, choosing her own clothes, and looking at herself with each new outfit. I find it easier to dress the bear over and over than to constantly change her clothes. The clothes go on via magnets which are strong enough to cling but soft enough for little hands to snap off. It might be nice if the magnets were just a tad stronger because in situations such as pretending the bear is walking or running, sometimes a piece of clothing drops off. Another thing that might have been nice would be a stand for the little bears to be upright, even with their shoes on.If she were to give this toy a star rating, I think she would go for a 6. I am a little bit more picky. Of the over 40 pieces, about 4 were a little bit rough around the edges and my husband had so smooth them out a bit with fine sandpaper. To avoid losing pieces, we only play at the table and I am with her the whole time. Otherwise, I cannot imagine what a mess this would be. Still, you have to lay out all the pieces so she can choose what to make the bears wear and it's a bit of a mess. It keeps her entertained for what is, for her, an amazingly long time. When my 4 year-old niece comes over, they each take a bear and play together (under my supervision) with a lot of giggles and no fighting or meltdowns. When the time comes to put it away, everything fits easily back into the box and there is an acrylic slide-on top that holds it all inIt should be noted that both bears have hair ribbons and all the clothes are for girls. Some reviewers find this objectionable, but I don't really think a boy would be interested in playing with this kind of toy in the first place. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The assortment of clothing is darling, and if you lay the bears flat the magnets still well.  There are many, many clothing options. However, when walking the bears upright the clothing did slide down.  I understand the trade off between kids being able to remove the clothing easily and having it stick well but the toy loses a bit of play value when the bears cannot be held upright for imaginative play.  The hats especially do not stick as well, since part of the magnet is not in contact with the head of the bear.  It would also be nice if the bears could stand upright on a stand in order to be displayed.The sliding cover is hard for  little hands to line up and slide in.  May need adult help to put the toy away.The concept for this toy is excellent, but I feel that the inability of the clothing to stick while the bears are played with decreases the play value.  If you have a little one only interested in switching out the outfits this will fit the bill.  If he/she will want to have the bears interact, this will be more of a problem. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We have had so much fun with these bears and all their outfits.  As a child I always loved playing with paper dolls, and these are even better.  My granddaughters(4 & 5 years old),and myself had a great time putting outfits together.  We dressed the bears for various occasions and activities, laughing and chatting the entire time.  We played that they were sister bears and then we played with them as a mother/daughter combo.I wish there were more bears.  I would love to see a couple of boy bears to add to this set. Good job T.S. Shure! [SEP]"",""[CLS] These T.S. Shure Pocket Bears Wooden Magnetic Dress-Ups are very cute and quite well made. Our 4-year old test subject immediately fell in love with the set and played with them for a very long time. We have three similar sets now and they all are great quality.The wooden pieces are nicely painted and the accessories attach via magnets and hold better than expected. I would have liked the accessories to be a little thinner but then they would also be easier to loose, so it is a bit of trade off.The wooden packaging case works fairly well.This would make a great gift and is quite fun.Highly Recommended!CFH [SEP]"",""[CLS] I think this set is a cute and durable set but seems to be only slightly enthralling for my three year old girl.  I thought she would be much more excited and want to play and dress up the bears.  We do like the fact that there are two bears which helps when playing with a friend.  There are several skirts (or tutu's), shoes, pants, hats, shirts, and even a dress up bee costume.  The case is nice, and unlike a previous magnetic set we received from T.S.

Ear plugs wouldn't be a bad idea.The good news is that the volume can be lowered to a tolerable level, the bad news is that the volume button is fun to press and on the mat so the kids really enjoy putting the volume back up.This is fairly large and I'll attach a photo with my 1 yr old on it for comparison.

Please keep that in mind when reading the rest of my review.  I will try to use the correct musical terminology...but bare with me!This is the tiniest little piano I've ever seen.  That alone makes it cute and adorable.  It is the absolute perfect size for a toddler.  My daughter was 2 when she received it, and you can see from the picture she fits it very well.  I've attached pictures with a ruler so you can see exactly how small it is.  This takes up almost no space...which is a huge plus for something that's still technically a toy!This piano also comes with some basic musical sheets.  They're very simple and designed with young pianists in mind.  There are no complicated multiple key holds or anything.  And everything is color coded and simple to understand (even for me!).I can't really speak to the pitch, key, or musical clarity of this piano.  It sounds fine to me.  But that's completely from a novice mom listening to a toddler bang the keys!This is a fun novelty toy.  It doesn't get much play at our house, but that could easily be because we, as parents, never really push it as something to play with.  If you have a child with any kind of musical talent or interest this would be a great size to get them started.

She is not that interested in the tunnel though so that piece has become a toy and puzzle station in her room. The pieces fasten together very strongly and stay put, however, it you separate them and rearrange them too many times the the Velcro does loose it's sticking power. Also, this was not a big deal for me as i don't use the two padded floor mats, but one of them did have a small tear in the material out of the box. And yes there is an odor when you first open this but it dissipates on its own after being aired out for a couple of days.

We are currently in an apartment, and even with the lack of space we love this thing!  My daughter has hypotonia (low muscle tone), and this structure has encouraged her to climb and pull to stand and just have a lot of fun!  Her physical therapist incorporates this structure every single time he works with her. There are so many benefits I could talk about, but this is just so much fun to have around. I can fit through the tunnel with a little effort, but there is no way my husband can because his shoulders are too broad.We have also removed one of the blue padded sections which decreases the ability of the sections to stay together, but not by too much. One blue padded section needs to stay attached at all times to keep everything together. The only reason we took one off is to make it easier for her to cruise on that side.Shipping was fast (my mother-in-law let me know it was coming) and it was delivered in a few pieces wrapped in heavy duty plastic. I'm sure our neighbors were wondering what all the brightly colored blocks were that were being delivered to our front door!I am just so so glad we got this. It is the perfect size for our 18 month old and will likely last a few more years to come. The only thing I wish is that we would have got this earlier!

His play room is complete with this set as it's a great addition for spontaneous, creative, and exciting playtime.  The tunnel and slide are both great and the structure itself enables a child to stand correctly and even walk.  All of his playmates gravitate toward this item when over for play.

B000JNE658,"[CLS] Great addition to our Melissa and Doug wooden train set. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Some Thomas train engines are too tall to go through the tunnel. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I actually struggled with rating this train track set.  It is one of two track sets I bought to use with our son over a year ago, who has some rather specialized needs and some serious fine motor challenges. I actually would put it at a 4.5, but that's not an option on the star system.So for us, this isn't the set we use as much, because a couple of the pieces are harder to put together, and the order is more difficult for my son to figure out.  The other Melissa and Doug set is just a circle, so it was a much better option for working on his fine motor track assembly skills in the beginning.Interestingly enough, my daughter, who is nearly 6 years older then our son, thinks this particular track is fun to play with.  So I think this one because of it's slight extra degree of complexity would appeal to a wider age range.  And on this one, the engine is way cooler looking then on the other Melissa and Doug set we bought. They actually fight over who gets to have it...he usually only wants to turn it upside down and spin the wheels, but we're working on that.  I will have to say this one will always have a fond place in my heart though because it's the first train set he actually moved the train along the tracks on, and I think it was because of the hill, he thought it was funny to watch the train coast down, so it motivated him more to use it on a functional level.So for us, this one is mostly positive, but because some of the pieces are harder to fit together, it's not quite a 5 star product in our house, but I think that has a useful place in the future for his targeted therapy goals, so it's not entirely a bad point.  I'm just thinking the ends are supposed to be cut to go together smoothly. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Very nice little starter set. Great price. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Recently purchased a second set of the Figure 8 Train Set, and it is much poorer in quality than the one we purchased a few years ago. Much of the track had blemished with chips, cracks, and miscuts, the bridge pieces are so uneven with each other that it derails the train (very frustrating for a two year old.) The design of the set has changed as the bridge is shorter overall and as a result, slightly steeper. This version of the set does not fit together very well in a figure 8 configuration and the train tends to derail where the track does not line up well. Clearly manufacturing standards have dropped and the quality and design of this product has diminished. I will be contacting Melissa and Doug for replacement track and failing that, this recently purchased set will be returned.The first set we purchased in 2011 was high quality, well finished, and something I would have recommended to anyone as a great starter set or expansion set with a wooden bridge. The track in the first set fits neatly together and the that first bridge is relatively smooth. Based on the low quality of the recent set we purchased, I would recommend you consider a different brand.:: rob's wife [SEP]"",""[CLS] We got this for our toddler girl for Christmas and she loves it. The pieces are solid and fit together easily - no rough edges and ill-fitting ends like in some other sets. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My child has been pretty rough with this, and there has been little damage. On our carpeted floor, we have never had a problem keeping the pieces together, though at times it can make gaps, which never seemed to bother my child. It fits with all of the other brands. The tabs that link together splinter a little with rough use. Nothing has broken though. The train included is a little generic but seems to roll fine. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I can't say enough good things about this set.  We received this as a special gift, but if I had purchased it, I would without hesitation call this my best toy money spent.  My two-year-old son has many toys he loves, but this is the only thing he wants to play with ALL THE TIME.  Seriously -- hours, every day.  The tracks are simple and sturdy enough that he puts them together himself, including the bridge -- if it weren't so solid, this wouldn't work for a kid this small.  And the train and its car are sturdy enough to have held up very well to round-the-clock play just about everywhere my son goes.  The painted engine and car are brightly colored, detailed, and cheerful.If you're thinking of this as a possible starting point for a wooden railway collection, I think it can't be beat.  In fact, the friend who purchased this for us has amassed a huge wooden train collection for her older son and got this for us as a starter.  This set on its own provides plenty of excitement for my two-year-old, but we have added on a bit already.  The track pieces are very high quality and compatible with everything we've tried, though it doesn't work very well with Ikea train stuff.  (The Ikea train sets, by the way, are a great bargain, but they'll also highlight the value of spending a little more on Melissa and Doug.)  As for train engines and cars, my only complaint is that the magnets on the train engine aren't polarized the same way as the Thomas trains.  Maybe this varies from train to train, but so far, all our Thomas engines are polarized so that they face the opposite way from the Melissa and Doug engine.  So if my son makes a big line-up of engines, it will be the Melissa and Doug engine facing the wrong way.  No big deal, though.This set is my son's favorite toy ever, and it's built so well that I know it will last us a long, long time.

B000K27MPO,"[CLS] I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old and 1 1/2 year old to play with at the park.  With a light wind, I can launch it with my hand - no need to play out lots of line, run, or anything -- just hold it over my head and let go.  I have flown it up to the limit of the provided string -- I think it's about 300', but it's most fun to fly it lower where the kids can see it better.  At really low altitudes it can drop quickly when the wind changes, but you can pull on the string or run to keep it up.  If I fly it up to about 80' or more where it's more stable, my 2 1/2 year old can hold it.  If I pull it in to about 10', I can run around the park with it flying just overhead, buzzing the toddlers with the tail.  It doesn't handle violent wind and gusts well, but it's not intended for that.  It's so easy it might get boring for someone capable of handling multi-string stunt kites, but for any Charlie Brown, this is the right kite.  There are other kites that fly easily, but these Easy Flyers are also supposed to have lighter line pull, making it less likely to pull or jerk the string out of a child's hand.  Still, for under 5 year olds I do most of the flying.  Therefore I'm going to try some helium balloons on the kite string instead.  I'm also keen to try a KongMing lantern.  Our area is popular for hot air ballooning and maybe when the kids are older we could build an RC balloon.  A kite like this can get a lot of things started.  Enjoy. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Kids and I had fun with this. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We bought this a year ago for our son who was 2.5 years old at the time. At first, I was a little skeptical for this one due to the relatively high price ($25 as of june 2013)  and went for a cheaper model&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/In-the-Breeze-Rainbow-Diamond-Kite-30-Inch/dp/B0020ZY3W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>In the Breeze Rainbow Diamond Kite, 30-Inch</a>. However it was a very frustrating experience with no luck getting the thing on air. After that failure, I wanted to give this one a try by paying almost double the price.The kite is easy to set up and looks pretty decent. I can not say this is a high end professional kite, but an excellent starter for a toddler. Most high end kites cost more than this and accessories like tail and the string are not included in the package. Both string and the tail are present for this model making it significantly cheaper than those kites despite being double the price of the basic ones.We could immediately get it on air with almost no difficulty and the balance was okay despite the strong turbulent wind. We only had one or two nose dives and apart from that it was a smooth flying experience. For those who are not sure whether the accompanying string is enough, I can say that it is more than enough if you are not after sending your stuff to the moon. The handle could have been better since releasing and pulling back may generate unpleasant knots from time to time and a circular design with two sided handles would do better. But if you are a starter like myself and only after some joy for your kids once in a blue moon, than I would not pay extra and buy a separate string.In conclusion, this mid grade kite has performed well during our outings under different strengths and patterns of wind. I think it is worth the extra bucks when compared to the basic cheaper models. But kite enthusiasts may find it somewhat limiting. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Even though this kite is a bit expensive, it is so easy to get into the air even with a light breeze.

My husband agrees with a previous reviewer who stated that you need a stiff wind to fly this kite, but since when do you fly a kite in a gentle, light breeze anyway?! Call it woman's intuition, but I just feel it in my bones when the wind is just right for this kite; the winds at the end of March are ideal, at least in the mountains of western NC.

I've found it to be extremely durable (even with teenaged boys being not-so-gentle), very comfortable and exactly what I wanted.  It sits on top of the water so if I don't want to get wet, I don't have to.  It supports me very comfortably while I read a book and sip a lemonade, no tipping or balance issues.  I'm of average weight/height.  If I didn't have children pretending to be mermaids & doing underwater fighting, I could probably take a nap in it.  I've had absolutely NO issues with the arms, they don't slide around or move at all -very stable and comfortable.  I use it both for sitting upright and lying on my stomach.  I actually like turning it over to sit sometimes because the wraparound arms make a perfect headrest.  I'm not sure how others are having problems with the arms slipping or moving, mine has two air chambers, one for the white part (the seat) and one for the blue part, (the arms).  The armrest is a single chamber that wraps around the entire back of the chair and is attached on the sides so it can't move at all.  Maybe other people are getting a different item, no idea.Be mindful of the weight limits on floating devices, I suspect those that have broken, sink or lose air are being used by people who are too heavy.

B000LEEBYQ,"[CLS] This is my 3 year old daughter's 4th doll stroller. This is her first expensive one - the others have been in the $8-35 range. I was really worried about spending that much and the stroller not lasting like the others, but I need not have worried.The frame is very large. In fact, it is the largest one I have purchased and I expect she will still be able to play with it when she is 8.It feels very sturdy and I don't worry about it tipping at all.It maneuvers very smoothly and responsively steers through our narrow hallways and sharp corners, even in the hands of my reckless 3 year old.The stroller has many options of a real stroller, such a standing board, canopy, lifting foot rest, etc. The seat can be changed to accommodate the matching baby carrier/car seat, but we have also discovered the car seat can clip on snugly behind the first seat. My daughter LOVES pushing her twins in it.The only thing I don't care for is the pattern. I wish it came in purple or a more modern pink, instead of that pepto bismol/My Little Pony color.UPDATE: My daughter is now 10 and has just outgrown the stroller as she is now too tall for it.

She isn't too tall for it, in fact she looks like a grown up pushing it. It is just like a real one, and is extremely durable.

Once Tamiya came on the scene I chosen them to be my Sherman Tank supplier as well as Italeri which is another fine scale model company. I used my M4A3 for a conversion project that came to mind where I switched hulls and turrets from one to the other to get the desired tanks. I still have both original tanks in their respective kit boxes and will build them each straight out of the box. I can never have too many Sherman tanks around. There are so many parts with the kits that one could supply at least two tanks and with the figures the complete crew can be represented. Be sure to see Hobbies in a Barn on Facebook for more.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] Good quality kit from Tamiya, though the kit is a bit dated - most of the parts come from the M4 Sherman from the late 1980s when Tamiya and other company(s) started to pay attention to detail/accuracy. Tamiya has many versions of the M4 Sherman and this is the late WWII version. If you bought/built any of the other Tamiya Sherman kits, this is identical to those, only difference is that there is a new parts tree for the infantry figures (same as the M4 105mm Howitzer version), turret figures, and the solid dish road wheels. The solid dish road wheels were introduced late 1944 and that is the primary subject matter for this kit. Also, the solid dish road wheels are open on the insides, so purists may want to add after market parts. The parts for the original crew members are still included. Also, the older kits would have the duck-dill track shoes in them: this kit has the rubber chevron version track shoes in single piece. The infantry figures are awesome and are some of the best that Tamiya has ever offered. The tank crew figures are just as great and now they are the standard crew figures in most Tamiya WWII kits being produced. You also get parts trees for extra stowage gear as well. Instruction sheet is easy to follow and gives a brief history of the M4 Sherman tanks in multiple languages. Also, there is recommendation for painting and decal placement. Overall, a very good kit, especially with the infantry figures and turret crew members. If anyone has ever built a Tamiya M4 Sherman tank before, this will be an easy/quick build. Yep - Dragon, Tasca, and other companies have kits that are more accurate in detail, but I'm not into all that as I get older.

B000LT2ILE,"[CLS] This vacuum is very cute and has realistic sounds along with its musical and learning modes.  Two problems I have with it are:1) It's REALLY SMALL.  My daughter is 18-months-old, of average height, and the handle is a little higher than her waist.  I couldn't tell this before I bought it because of the way the thing is packaged.  Had I known, I might have opted for a different vacuum.2) The handle doesn't stand up like a real vacuum, so the wheels always roll out to make it lay flat.  Kind of a bummer, but I wish I could just store it in a corner like I do a real vacuum.One good thing is that it has a volume control, so it's not that loud. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I got this vacuum for my son when he was a little older than 1 year old and it worked perfectly. My son has always been on the tall side of things. However, as he grew, it has stopped working so well because it is so short! That's why this lost a star for me. I also really like that it has a volume control. There are also many different activities that can be done. For example, it makes a real life vacuum noise (which was my son's favorite because it sounds real sucking things up) as well as sings songs. It has a switch to turn on and off, a rotating middle (to see the dirt) and some fun pieces by the face. It also doesn't stand on its own which is nice in the fact my son could move it but it got to be hard when storing. It had to lean against a wall. The batteries also lasted quite a while which was nice. My son is 3 now and we have to put it away because he is too tall. :( I'm not disappointed in buying it though as he had so much fun running to grab his vacuum whenever I took ours out and helping. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this for my son because he loves my vacuum, but he never plays with it.

AND IN THE END... THAT IS WHAT MATTERS...BUT PERSONALLY... I WAS DIAPPOINTED [SEP]"",""[CLS] The die-cast metal toys from the Cars movie are great - detailed, well-made and a lot of fun.  The Mack Truck Playset is a disappointment by comparison for a couple reasons.  First, it's made of pretty low-quality molded plastic.  This makes the detailing blurry and also makes the moving parts feel flimsy and sometimes ill-fitting.  Second, it's just not very interesting despite the number of things to do.  Aside from pretending to wash and work on your other die-cast cars, there isn't much potential for imaginative play.  And even those play areas are very simplistic.  Our five-year-old has loved all of his Cars toys but Mack pretty much stays forgotten in the closet. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We had bought this for our 4yo for Christmas after seeing how much enjoyed it at his friends place. The toy is basic, I mean Lightning McQueen pretty much lives in Mack while he is on the road, so there are 3 sections...the bathroom area (shower and sink), the living room with tv and video games, and the kitchen with his fridge and stuff heneeds to run.  Mack is basically Lightning McQueen's home.  So if you buy this keep that in mind...it is his home!Now for the problems.  Yes, the shower peices do pop off and they can be popped back on.  So we did the quick fix...a drop of superglue and they stay put, and it doesn't affect the way it closes either.  The other problem is for the price they could have added the $3 Lightning McQueen car to Mack, because McQueen is part of Mack, and kids pretty much expect McQueen to be there.This toy also has a double feature which I really do appreciate.  Not only is it a playset, but it is also Mack.  My son keeps the set closed so it is Mack Truck and he takes his Lightning McQueen and has the 2 talk and ride around together, so it is almost like getting 2 toys in one.Also, buy it when it is on sale, like we did!  IMO, $20 is a bit much for this item.  For $20 you can get a bigger more exciting playset, like the Matchbox pop-ups. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 3-year old took this to show'n'tell at his school and was pretty-much mobbed by the other kids. He played with it for 3 hours straight the day that he got it; there's so many cool things inside. Refrigerator, TV/video console, tire-changing, car-wash, and on and on and on. The 2 downsides to this are 1) the pieces inside are very flimsy and come off very easily. They're easily put back together, but also easily lost! 2) it's really hard to open/close. My son had a couple of nasty pinches while learning how to close.Having said that, I would not let it deter you from buying this toy. We're getting one for 2 of my son's friends this christmas, that's how much we love it in our house!. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Both my sons, 4 1/2 and 2 love this toy.  After having it awhile it still holds their interest. The only complaint I have is that the interior of the truck is pretty fragile.  The mirror has broken off countless times, as has part of the carwash (which was eventually lost). That hasn't impeded play any, but is the reason I didn't score it higher.

Barricade has great detail whether in robot or saleen S281 police car mode. Barricade is one of the best decepticons from the movie and the figure is just as good. This bad boy comes with some sweet features like a sping-loaded punch attack and his trusted partner frenzy which can be stored in the grill area in vehicle mode just like in the movie. Barricade has great articulation for detail in his legs,body,and head piece while having equal decor in vehicle mode with the decepticon police symbol and the saying to punish and enslave along the side. The poseability of Barricade is outstanding with great stability for acting out battle scenes or displaying where you please. The durability is excellent as well with Barricade having secure joints that can easily snap back into place if there is any trouble while having a solid build to handle any situation that comes around. The transformation level is advanced meaning if you have plenty of experience with transformers there is mid-level difficulty. If you are a parent buying for a child of 5-6 or younger you might have to help some in the process. Honestly Barricade is very versatile for all ages with a managable transformation that can be learned easily with practice. Barricade is one of the best decepticons to get in the deluxe line.

Barricade Rocks and transformers Rule!!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I actually had this figure since the first movie.  I didn't play with him that much for some reason, probably just wasn't feeling the Decepticon vibe.  I fished him out with the advent of ROTF, was mistified with how much charm this bad guy had.  I must say the vehicle mode looks great.  Lots of detail, the plastic looks to be a very good quality.  The sirens are modeled with the clear red and blue plastic that adds a nice touch.  Turning him into the car can be a bit annoying, since all the panels have to fit in exactly in place.  His robot looks as nice as the vehicle.  He has all kinds of little panels and spikes that you might not notice(took me two years, heh) at first, but add the how you can transform him.  I proudly display him next my other favorites like ROTF Prime and Megatron.  Very durable, very playable and very poseable.  His punching had can get a bit annoying, but it's managable.  Having the Frenzy figure is nice as well. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I got this guy awhile ago and I loved his character. I like him for his car mode.

B000MOHJN0,"[CLS] I'm very happy with this basketball hoop and don't understand the negative hoopla (nyuk  nyuk  nyuk) from a couple reviewers.The hoop was easy to assemble - took me about 10 minutes without help.  I agree the instructions were minimal, but this isn't rocket science to assemble it.  And, yes, the instruction page implies some of the parts are pre-glued, but if they had been you wouldn't be able to get the net on, so get over it!  Glue is an option, but I chose to use the small screws included (I figure I can glue it if the screws wear out - PVC pipe glue should do the trick).A couple insights that may help make assembly easier: Don't screw anything together until you have the whole thing assembled.  One or two pipes may come loose from their connectors during assembly process, but they're easy to put back in.Assemble the base first, using the slightly smaller straight T-connectors (the alightly larger T's have an angled/curved T-bar).  The 3 foam cuffs slide (only slight pressure needed) onto each of the 3 base pipes (obviously do this before you push the pipes into the T-connectors).Assemble the top (the hoop) next, using the 3 slightly larger, angled T-connectors.  It's easier to slide the loops of the net onto each hoop pipe before you insert the hoop pipe into the T-connector.  4 loops of the net go on each pipe (there are 12 loops and 3 pieces of pipe that make the hoop - do the math yourself...).Stick the straight upright pipes into the T-connectors on the base, then stick the other ends of the straight pipes into the T-connectors on the hoop.  Since the base is a larger diameter than the hoop, the T-connectors will need to be at a slight angle.  This is the only place where you may need to finesse the connectors - basically rotating them a little so that the upright pipes are at the needed angle to connect the top and bottom.  Again, it's not rocket science and was simple to do.Use the screws in the T-connector holes to hold everything together.  Make sure the pipes are all the way in the T-connectors before screwing in the screws.  If you prefer to use PVC pipe glue, have at it!Don't be scared off by a couple negative reviews about difficulty of assembly or poor product quality.  It went together easily and quickly.  The ball comes deflated, but they include a (albeit cheap) ball needle for inflation.  All you need is a bike pump.And my grandkids love it.  They're all grade school age, so I can't speak to whether the hoop would hold up to teenagers - but it's built pretty atrong.  I might break out the glue for better durability if I had teens using it.Oh, and great marks on shipping - it came quickly and the product box was inside a second amazon shipping box, so it arrived in pristine condition.Big thumbs up!

But he does really enjoy making the project so that is tolerable to me.There are PLENTY of stickers for each scene as well.  Very colorful and vibrant stickers often way more than are needed for each scene, kind of a bonus IMO.The scene is a lightweight cardboard\tagboard material, making it more durable for the little hands to not bend or crease.the plastis frames are fun as well and just a simple inlay to attack the finished works of art.

Mom can check email!No scissors needed.Multiple sets, individually wrapped, convenient.CONS:There are way too many stickers!  How can that be a CON?  Because there are so many that the child isn't really able to place them coherently on the scenes.  You could probably cover the cardboard twice with all the stickers given for each set.Since there's no following of directions, there's not much to learn.  A cheap $1.00 sticker book at Michael's could achieve the same thing.

The tub is plenty big enough to hold all the pieces without a problem, however you do have to take apart the base to fit those pieces in.  We may have just gotten a set with extra tough fasteners, but putting those flat squares together to form the base was REALLY hard.  They didn't want to slide together or be pushed together and I ended up with a few bruises for my efforts (very forceful pushing), but eventually got them to fit together.The kids (big brother helped just a little) then set to figuring out how to get the gear pieces to interlock so that they turned one another in multiple directions.  After a few false starts they had success and developed a fairly elaborate setup that would go both forward and backward with the motorized control and the lights flashed appropriately (and were greatly enjoyed).  They were very pleased with their creation, but then disassembled it and put the pieces back in the tub.  I wonder if it will be sought out for play again.  So far, it hasn't.I think that for children who love building and are always looking for another way to satisfy that urge, plus are reasonably handy with interlocking pieces, this set is a good choice.  It offers the opportunity for imaginative play and repeated use for the right child.  On the other hand, it may be a one-trick wonder for children who don't have that natural need to build and rebuild. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Our 5 year old gradaughter loved this sets...as did Grandpa and Daddy!  Wonderful things can be built, moved by the little engine..and the lights flashing off and on!  The stickers were easy to put on...she did them all, and it's great fun to see all the different structures that can be built.  HIGHLY recommend this toy!  Gears fit together great! [SEP]"",""[CLS] As far as 'building toys' go, this is a great one!  My 3 yr old can lay them out on all the base pieces while the 5 yr old can build towers.  Our 'remote' broke not so long after we got it which was annoying.  Even when it worked, you couldn't hook it up to too large of a structure b/c the little motor wasn't strong enough to turn them.  The kids REALLY enjoyed the blinking lights, but the glow in the dark stickers are silly.  They're just nice decorations, they don't actually 'glow' very much at all.  Overall, I recco this toy the kids really do enjoy building with it! [SEP]",[CLS]  [SEP],https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5137H1xDoxL.jpg
B000MWY9IK,"[CLS] Cutest set of play food my daughter owns!!  The plastic food is softer than the cheepo brands so they don't dent and crush.  It's also easier to handle and hold together (for ex. the sandwich doesn't slip apart).  My 5 year old loves them. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 2 year old loves it! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Let me preface by saying that I got an awesome deal from Amazon Deal of the Day so i bought this basket at a much cheaper cost than the daily cost. That said, I have to say that I'm a little disappointedly. The material is wonderful- well made, very realistic looking and truly great quality. These qualities are exactly what I was looking for.But there is very little in terms of actual stuff, especially considering the full price. 2 slices of bread, two slices of turkey, cheese, pretzels, celery, milk and a couple of other things plus the basket wasn't much, especially given the small size of all things included. Again, the quality was wonderful (loved the milk!) and for the price I paid, I'm ok with it but I was a bit disappointed. But I still LOVE Learning Resources play food overall. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Did not like this set. Returned to Amazon for refund. In particular, the bread just looked n___y. The items were to large. Would prefer smaller for child's play. And the milk carton was ridiculous! Just like one in the dairy cabinet at your grocery store. Celery was nice. Felt like I was paying for a basket, when all I wanted was good plastic child's play food! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I got this set for my 22-month-old son who is just starting to get into pretend play. I also purchased the Green Toys Dish Set to use with it. He loves making sandwiches and soup with this set and the dishes and spent about 30 minutes with it when we first opened it. That is a long time for him to play with anything.The cheese and lettuce and my favorites. He tried to bite the cheese when he first saw it. It resembles a Kraft single slice. He enjoyed pretending to pour the milk into the cups and into bowls to make cereal. He likes to put things into the basket and carry them around.This set is well worth the money spent. I plan to get him the dinner and breakfast sets, too. I washed everything before I let him play with it because a couple of the pieces looked dirty. They washed up easily.I recommend getting some kind of dish set to use along with this. Great, durable play food that should last us many years. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We really enjoyed the flexibility of the lettuce and turkey that made them seem so realistic. Love the health aspect of everything included here, very nice. My son is 6 and still enjoys play food, we have quite a collection by now. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Although I received this lunch basket with 2 missing items I have to say that it exceeded my expectations when it came to the quality of play food. I love how flexible most of the play food are and how realistic they look but the sizes are off. The package label indicates that this toy are for 3+ years old due to choking possibility. I gave my 16 month old everything except the celery sticks to play with and she loves it. She is even learning how to recognize and repeat most of the food.In this review I will give you a breakdown of what is included and the approximate size of the items for parents that are concerned about choking hazard.This healthy lunch basket comes with:- A BASKET (10.5 x 5 x 8)- A carton of MILK (2.75 x 2.75 x 3.25)- An ORANGE (2.5 round)- Bunch of GRAPES (3.75 x 2.25)- A LETTUCE leaf (5 x 4.5)- A slice of cheddar CHEESE (2.75 x 3.25)- 2 TURKEY slices (4.5 x 3)- 2 slices of whole wheat BREAD (3 x 4 x .5)- 2 knotted PRETZELS (2.75 x 2 .5)- 4 CELERY sticks (.5 x 3 x .5)- Tomato slice missing and Activity card missingMy 16 month old is still mouthing everything and I was a little concern that a lot of the food might be too small and she would choke on it. To my surprise the only thing that seemed dangerous were the celery sticks. So I removed it. The toy comes with a warning sheet that tells you to wash all before use, which I did. I then noticed that there were HOLES in the milk, orange, breads and pretzels. So my recommendation is not to soak it in soapy water or it will take a long time to dry out and squeeze all the water out. Size-wise the bunch of grapes are too small and the pretzels seems really big. Everything else were pretty close to real-life food. I love the basket because its very sturdy and my little girl can use it in the future when she role plays supermarket shopping. We have 2 already from learning resources veggies and dinner.Overall this is a great product that shows food realistically, encourages healthy eating habits and teach my toddler food she can recognize and touch without using real food or just looking at flashcards. She was able to remember and repeat words like carrot, apple, celery, onion, lettuce, banana, pear and pepper from the first basket when she was 14 months. I am hoping for the same in this one.<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Learning-Resources-Fruit-Vegetable-Basket/dp/B00005J38T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Learning Resources Fruit Vegetable Basket</a> [SEP]"",""[CLS] I have purchased many of the Learning Resources Food Baskets.

I don't like the idea of filling up a pinata with a bunch of artificially colored, gross sugary candy (I have a toddler- he doesn't need to eat candy!)-so I hunted for alternatives a 2 year old would be excited about---these were a great answer! I will be putting some more naturally based, quality candy in the pinata too as well as some little finger laser lights and small toys too but the balls will undoubtedly be my son's focus when the pinata bursts. I also think the balls' bounce and shape will create a bigger area for collecting the goodies-which is nice since trampling and more aggressive participants can make getting at the contents difficult when they aren't well distributed.Since our family has many, much older kids than my son- I feel these bouncy balls will be more fun than just candy- even for the sadistic teenagers-they'll probably throw them at each other or drop them from a bridge or a car...but with 250-there should be enough for them and my son. I will be keeping about 30 on hand at home and in the car for backup when these run out.I gave this 4 stars because these are nowhere near as bouncy as many bouncy balls I have had in the past- including some really old ones that have started to harden-which were probably from the 50's (estate find).I'm not too disappointed about it though- because the quantity, variety and wow factor is what I am going for and these were a great price and will fulfill their purpose beautifully!

This replica is soft to touch and features a blood-red hourglass on its belly. It is part of the Hidden Kingdom Collection, which includes oversized replicas for closer inspections, especially useful for inquisitive young eyes. While the Safari Ltd Hidden Kingdom Black Widow Spider is bigger than a real black widow, it is still terrifyingly realistic. Life-like, educational, and fun, this figurine is suitable for a range of interests, including collectors, enthusiasts, teachers, and kids. Admire it on a shelf, use it in the classroom, or simply enjoy playing with it! Product measures 7L x 4.7W x 2H. For ages 3 and up.

This game is centuries old that has been played and loved by sailors and fishermen, and now you can enjoy it too in your very own home. Simply roll the dice and flip over any combinations of tiles that match the numbers you rolled. Then, continue rolling until the numbers you roll no longer match the tiles - this is the end of your turn. If the tiles add up to six or less, only roll one die. You can figure out your score by reading left to right - the lowest score wins the game. This game is fun to play with a group of friends but can also be enjoyed with only two people. Everything you need is included in the classic style mahogany finish box and has an attractive look even while being stored in a business office or study, and even your elegant home living room.

When my son was 10months I had gotten him a couple baby Fisher Price puzzles and he did great with them, so I went looking for others and was so excited to discover Melissa and Doug puzzles. The first one I ordered was a sea life puzzle of theirs which had about 8 pieces however I realized when my then 12-month-old first tried it out that it was too difficult for him to grasp the very small knobs at his age so I put it away and checked again, luckily I discovered this and other Melissa & Doug puzzles with large knobs and 3-4 pieces. They are so well made and perfect for his age - he's now 15 months old and still plays with this puzzle every time I take it out for him. So if you're looking for a beginner Melissa and Doug puzzle for babies around the 12-18 month range I'd start with this one for sure :) [SEP]"",""[CLS] We got this for our 11 month old and he is really enjoying it. The colors are bright and attractive. He loves using the knobs to pull the pieces out and play with them. It is fun to name the animals and make their noise when he takes each piece out. He really gets a kick out of the noises and trying to make them himself too. I love the shape of the puzzle too, which just adds to the cuteness of it.He does still mouth things, but we haven't had any problems with the moisture. Though I am sure with enough drool, the ply would not hold up very well. A bit of a bummer, but we are keeping an eye on it.

B000NN9DUC,"[CLS] Excelent [SEP]"",""[CLS] I was overjoyed after blowing this up because this slide is freaking HUGE!  It's MUCH BIGGER than others like it.But...a couple of issues:1) There is NO bottom anchor to keep it from not moving.  Other slides like this will have a bottom part that you fill with water to keep the slide from going anywhere.  Not this one!  There is NOTHING to keep this in place, making it move all over the place including it escaping into the middle of the pool.  That sucks!2) Because you constantly have to keep pulling the slide BACK in place over and over again, it split the seam at the very top to where it was a gaping hole large enough to put a child's fist in it.  In other words, it can't be repaired, especially with that useless patch they give you for repairs.The good news, the company I bought it from (VM INNOVATIONS) had me send in a piece of the slide to them so they could replace it.  This is their policy provided that it's within 60 days.  So I have a second one coming to me as a replacement.Still, if I would have known that there is no way to weight this down to keep it in place, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place, as I'm predicting that the next slide I get will also last a single weekend before ripping apart.  Totally flawed design.  Don't bother!UPDATE:  Received the 2nd slide (for free) from the vendor BUT it also lasted 2 days and then the seam split in the EXACT same location as the prior slide we had.  I reduced my review from 3 stars to 1 star.  DO NOT BUY unless you're looking for something that will only last a weekend...perhaps for a BBQ pool party or something.

They brought the other themed decorations together for little cost. This project was cost efficient, and fun to do. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought these to use in my K-2 classroom. I made my own sign that said Classroom Rules and put it in the middle. To make an even border I only used 8 of these. We will talk about what these rules mean and how to follow them when I start school next week. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My kids really enjoy Dr. Seuss and since we are working on phonics - I thought I would purchase this. If your child is very familiar with Dr. Seuss, this is a great tool to use when teaching phonics. In fact, many Dr. Seuss books (particularly the rhyming books with plenty of made up words) are a great way to teach phonics to children, so the two go hand in hand.You get five large boards: 1) Consonants, 2) Vowels, 3) Beginning Blends, 4) Ending Blends, and 5) DigraphsThe boards feature pictures of various characters from Dr. Seuss books. I like that they feature characters from not just the major books like Cat in the Hat and Green Eggs and Ham, but also books like Hop on Pop.The reason for 4 stars and not five is that the boards fall into a trap the fells many phonic programs - and that is trying so hard to stay in a style they ignore the actual phonic sound. For instance the consonant board features and x-ray for the letter x. While this is appropriate for teaching letters, it isn't for teaching phonics. For simple words, it is best to feature words like fox and box which have the consonant at the end, but utilize the more appropriate sound. If you teach the phonic sound for x from the word x-ray, the child quickly learns to violate this rule for most of the sounds they encounter. It also falls short on phonics because it features too few sounds. In trying to isolate the sound, it introduces only the hard c sound. While this is common in many phonics programs, it still is problematic, especially in today's society when even young children know what a cell phone and even the word city isn't out of the reach of most 1st graders.So, use it as a great way to reinforce phonics and like I said, I am a big fan of using Dr. Seuss books when teaching phonics. We use Bob Books and throwing in Dr. Seuss definitely helps with the monotony.If a child isn't familiar with Dr. Seuss, some of the boards will be hard to understand. I can see a school teacher using them during Dr. Seuss week, having them in a Dr. Seuss section of a library, or in a home school classroom. I would definitely recommend them, just make sure to tell your child they are just a sample and not complete for phonic sounds.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] Freeze Up: 2-8 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 2-10 MinutesWe all found the unit easy to handle and use.  There are quite a few buttons on the device, though the four page manual does a good job explaining the rules and provided a ton of pictures to help players out in learning the interface.  It's also worth pointing out that batteries came included in the game itself...back in my day (presumably before the wheel was invented), this was a rarity, sort of like winning the lottery.I appreciate the addition of the manual mode, especially since my reflexes are slowing down in my old age.  The high-strung may also get stressed out playing on auto, making manual mode a great alternative.  I myself prefer the manual mode, only because I get too tempted on auto to hit the FREEZE button and then run from the table with the device in hand while the next player's time falls to zero.  Playing Keep Away has never been so fun.The game itself has a lot of potential in the classroom, since it's designed to accommodate anywhere from two to eight players.  It would serve as a great educational tool on a grade school level, especially in the areas of vocabulary.  Teachers could take the game a step further by placing the game on manual and requiring the students to spell the word after hitting the FREEZE button.With that said, we found the game to be pretty challenging.  Even as an adult, I found myself freezing up (hence the name) on a regular basis to the point where the NEW CATEGORY and NEW LETTER buttons began to form a union.  Individuals like myself who don't operate well under pressure may have a difficult time with Freeze Up, but those who keep the atmosphere casual will more than likely still find the game enjoyable.Based on the game's simplicity, there's not much else to say except that the game was well received by our family.  Freeze Up is not only fun to play, but is educational to boot.  It's for this reason that I recommend the game to both families and schools alike, especially if you have or are teaching kids who are struggling in their Language Arts classes.

That's it-- but the puzzles are quite well thought out, varied, engaging, and arranged in difficulty levels sufficient to challenge most children.  As a tool for building deductive and critical thinking skills, it is worth its weight in gold.I am not sure whether there is overlap with the Logic Links books; there are 100 or so puzzles in each book, and 166 total puzzles by comparison here.

The daddy of the expected someone loves to fish so I thought this would be quite appropriate...at least for Daddy! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Great toy for baby. Fish fit easily in hand, and the opening is big enough to put the fish in. But it is a bit difficult to retrieve them and definitely needs an adult to get them out. But its nice to have a place to put all the pieces away when done with play time. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this fill and spill fishbowl and the M & D fill and spill bug jar one for grandmas and one to go home.  I was surprised to find the fish attached (more than just tacked) with thread to the bottom of the tank.  I was carefully able to get 3 toys out but the fourth one wouldn't come.  I was afraid to tug too hard for fear of tearing the bottom mesh but that's what happen.  I'm very disappointed its damaged barely out of the box even before baby gets to see it!  I like the sizes of the critters in the fishbowl over the larger bugs. I don't see the necessity of attaching the toys so well especially since the same brand bug jar were not attached. I wanted to give both these fill and spills 5 stars but I can't honesty give either a 5. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a great learning toy.  Our son loved putting the objects in side and taking them out.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] This toy never became a hit in our household because the opening is too narrow. It was hard for my daughter to squish toys into it, and definitely too hard to spill them out of it-- I'd have to pull them out for her, and that got boring for both of us. They'd wind up just sitting there, stuck.Eventually, we gave up on the bowl and she just played with the little creatures in her playpen. The creatures are super cute... but I could have bought things like that cheaper if I were going to just use them as stuffed animals. What sold it to me was the fishbowl aspect, which looks great, but doesn't work in execution.

B000NV7L4E,"[CLS] I bought this for my 28 month old grandson and he loves it. This is very well made. Not only can you teach a large variety of animals to your little ones but they can match shapes and insert the animals into the ark. Everything is contained in the ark making for a tidy toy and something easy to take along with you. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We have a TON of Melissa & Doug toys that we love.  This is the first one I have ever purchased where they really missed the mark.  The first & biggest issue are the 2 doors.  When you pull them open they retract back due to an elastic attachment.  Not only did it pinch my child's finger but, it also snapped shut on mine too and let me tell you..it HURT!  No to mention, it's frustration for a toddler when he wants the door to stay open and it won't.  Then, my toddler, who was sitting on his knees playing with it, lost his balance and hit his face on the corner and it's pretty darn sharp.  (Other Arks I have researched today are all rounded) on that outer edge.  So safety is my biggest complaint by far.  But there are 3 other issues browsers should be aware of:  #1.) The colors are NOT as advertised.  In the picture online and even the picture on the bottom of the product...the colors look bright & vivid.  The product I received had muted/faded colors.  Most of the animals look a little greenish because they are printed over the blue block I guess.  #2.) The animals are so thin that really, you can fit just about any animal into any hole, making the shape sorting aspect pretty useless until they are too old to even care about shape sorting.  It would have been better w/ out that feature and with a way to lift the roof and have 2 levels to put the animals on...a way to simply play pretend.  #3.)  The ark is not even real wood!  It's made of particle board!All in all...a very disappointing toy from Melissa & Doug that does not live up to their reputation. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We received this as a gift for our son.  It is really cute, and durable.  He has a lot of fun matching up the pairs of animals and telling me what they all are.  And it's perfect to tell the story of Noah's ark.  If you are actually trying to get a shape sorter toy though, this is not the one.  You can pretty much put any animal in any hole.  My son doesn't actually have to try and match the animal to the right place.  This isn't really that big of a deal though, and it still provides a lot of entertainment for us. [SEP]"",""[CLS] A wood ark with holes cut in side, two ddors that open and close spring operated.  The animals are cute but have a blue outline that is well...kinda blue.

My daughter can spend ages pushing all the animals into the ark and then fips down the side (very nice safe opening mechanism!) and starts again!No real cons but things to be aware of:- heavy for a little one - my daughter is determined to pick up and carry everything and this is just light enough that she can pick it up but just heavy enough to cause a bruise when she dropped it on foot - and then on my foot!- yes the wood does become a bit worn with use (and repeated bashing on the tile floor) but it does stay safe. I would love this to be the toy that we keep and pass onto our grandchildren (my daughter is only 1 year old so I'm being a bit preemptive here) but am not sure it will last that long but do think it will last throughout my daughter's childhood and that's good enough!

I remember thinking at the time that I wasn't that thrilled with it, since we are not super into sports.  That doesn't mean our son won't be!

Then one of us put him in our lap and the other threw the ball to him.  We pretended to have him catch it and then we guided his arm to throw it back.  He giggled and smiled the entire time!  Now at 10.5 months he can throw the balls, with a good amount of accuracy, back to us.  He also likes to throw and chase them around the living room and crawl around with them in his mouth like a dog.  He gets a kick out of it.These are nice and durable and very soft.  They are definitely one of his absolute favorites and he likes to take them out of the mesh bag and try to put them back in.  We took them to grandma's a few weeks ago for mother's day and his cousins, ranging from 1-2 also loved them!  I can see this toy lasting a long time.  I take back every negative thought I had about them in the beginning.  I think we may have a sports fan!

My kids are under age 8, and all need to be entertained by just a few, select toys because we don't have the space in our bathroom for much storage.  So this seemed like a great idea!  So far the kids love the rings, but I am not a fan of the penguins.  Super cute, but each has a hole in them!  After the first bath using these they have been sitting on the floor towel trying to get the dry - it's been 2 days and still I can hear the water inside when I shake them.  So I really think these aren't going to last long.  I think the rings on their own are pretty boring, so I know they will be annoyed if I pitch the penguins in the trash.

Featuring a number of pieces of construction equipment, it has enough distinct areas to prevent a child becoming frustrated because they cannot distinguish which piece fits into a particular area.Ravensburgers Construction Crowd puzzle is sturdy and the illustration is firmly attached to the backing.  This should prevent those children who take everything apart from peeling the puzzle pieces apart.  The die-cuts are smooth, allowing for easy assembly.  Pieces fit together well.  They are not so tight that a child will become frustrated, nor so loose that the puzzle will fall apart if jostled slightly.  Even the box Ravensberger has used is sturdy.Although recommended for ages 5 - 15 years of age, I think older children would be uninterested in a puzzle that is so simple.  However, younger children with whom an adult is playing can enjoy Ravensburgers Construction Crowd puzzle.

B000NZN608,"[CLS] I purchased for a birthday gift, so I hope he likes it. I was expecting something a little sturdier, so I'm glad I didn't spend the money on the bigger version. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a really neat concept - that the corners unzip and the box flattens into a play mat.  The lid is also 'terrained' and adds extra interest.  It's made of durable vinyl plastic that looks like it will last a long time.  My daughter greatly enjoys playing with it and I like that it zips up.  The dinosaurs are tiny but it is easy to go to the dollar store and find more in that size for more play value.The reason I rate this 4 star instead of 5 is that it doesn't have a closer so the lid just fits on loosely.  It would have been better to have velcro or some kind of snap to keep the lid on since it falls off quite easly.  And the dinosaurs are tiny and very cheap - look like the cheapos you get from China with bad molding and poor painting. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Nice container. Very small. Lid comes off easily.

It is ok, but not great. Honestly, if I had it to do over again, I would leave it off his Christmas list and buy a rubbermaid tub instead.  For one, it is small. It does not hold very many dinosaurs. Even when I leave out my son's bigger dinosaurs (because seriously, only like one of those would fit in there and until I tried to fit them in there, I didn't think they were that big).  It only really fits much smaller dinosaurs in it, or a few medium sized ones if you are lucky. Another complaint is that it really isn't that durable. I mean, it has not broken yet. But it very easily bent out of shape very quickly, and I cannot get it to bend back into a box shape. When you have a small child who is going to be shoving stuff into it, falling on it, etc, it needs to be able to halfway hold its shape. The lid doesn't really stay on it now and it just looks all misshapen.  Finally, my son doesn't really play with the case. Even with it unzipped. It just doesn't have much for play, just a flat little thing with trees and dinos printed on it.  Not that that is a huge complaint, because I got it more for storage than anything else, but I did notice he doesn't really care to play with the case itself.  So overall it is just ok. You would do better to buy an $8 plastic tub to store them in if you are mostly looking for storage and your kid is a pretty big dino enthusiast like mine.

They came in a tube and they're almost impossible to get back in the same way they were originally packed.  This does the job I wanted it to, and my son likes the scene on the playmat.  It's big enough for my toddler, but I agree with other reviewers that for an older child, you might want to get the larger size.  I also agree that some velcro to keep the lid on would be a big help.  My complaint is that when open, it doesn't lie flat.  It's hard for the little dinos and their plastic trees to stand upright, which is kind of a drag.  Perhaps after we've had it a while, it will loosen up?  Anyway, it's a cute item at a bargain price, and any storage that's fun for kids to use helps with organization, so I'm pleased with it for now.

It takes just a bit of practice to learn how some of the pieces fit together. As you build the models, this becomes less of any issue. There are several manuals included so you can have multiple projects being built by students concurrently. My kit had only one book #2 and four book #1's. There are instructions for building 30 different machines, using over 1400 parts. As I mentioned in my previous review, the parts are high quality plastic, individually colored, and encased in a large bin with plastic snap-on lid. Pieces are grouped together in plastic bags, but I think as the models are dismantled, they will all be mixed together in the bin at some point. That's why the color coding is so handy, as manuals are printed in color, showing where the pieces fit. Nonetheless, I think that opening a bin having 1400 pieces mixed together would at first appear daunting.The CD contains pdf's for the teacher. These can be viewed on a computer, tablet, or printed. There are sets of guided questions to ask for most of the models. This helps directs discussion for the group and leads to further understanding of what each machine can do. It appears that a lot of thought has been put into this part of the product. I think the CD is key to making this kit a valuable educational tool, rather than just a play kit.Some of the models are very simple (wrench, bottle opener, hammer, etc) and some are complex (transmission, dump truck, carousel). So this kit would appeal to students in middle school up to high school. Home school parents should definitely look into this type of kit. It is so much more interesting for students to do hands-on building of models, rather than just read about them in a book. I remember having a similar experience when I was a Cub scout and built a crane and other models to earn merit badges. I am glad to see that this type of learning experience is still being promoted, and done so well with the K'nex series of products. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My husband and I are classroom teachers, but I got this set for my son to work with.  He loves to build things and is extremely interested in science.  What a cool set to have around that combines science concepts with concrete/hands-on building simple machines.  My son is 10 years old (4th grade) and was fully capable of building the mini-structures on his own with no guidance. His only complaint was that there were no written instructions for him to follow.  He said the instructions were picture only and he would have liked to have had written instructions to go along with each building project.  He built a lever, pulley, balance, and other simple machines.  There are teacher lesson plans to go with each simple machine.My husband will be taking this set to his after school program to work with students.  I will be updating my review after he has used it with a group of students. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Knex Educational Simple Machines is a huge set that you can do a lot of projects. Not only the models on the booklet but a lot of ideas of your own. My 9-year-old son already used this for one of his projects in 4th grade. He tinker with it together with his younger sister of 7. Following the instruction is not really hard for a 4th or 3rd grader, although on the box it says 14 and up. The only hard part is snapping together some of the parts which may or may not need the help of an adult.There are multiple copies of instructions books (Book 1 and Book 2) included which is great. That way you are not forced to share a book which can be annoying sometimes. The projects are listed below:BOOK 1Levers : hammer, balance, nutcrackerPulleys: tow truck, block & tackle, elevatorWheels & Axles: screwdriver, paddlewheel boat, sawmill,Inclined Planes: dump truck, Archimede's screwGears: conveyor belt, rack & pinion, crank fan, carousel, transmissionBOOK 2Levers: bottle opener, scissors, tongs, stapler, rowboat, fishing rod, grand pianoPulleys: garage door, craneWheels & Axles: wrench & nutInclined Planes: spiral staircase, axeGears: chainsaw, eggbeaterThis is a great educational toy that like Legos, not only provides hours and hours of fun, but also promote creativity and thinking. I rate this 5 stars. It is a little expensive but it worth the price. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I work for a technology company that gives employees two paid volunteer days every year to do STEM activities (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math).  We go to schools, boy scout meetings, science and technology-related events, science club for girls...you name it, we're out there trying to share a love of STEM and to encourage an interest.  This set really appealed to me because although we can show our products and to some extent explain the technologies with kids (sometimes it's a customer service rep who goes, so not everyone has the same level of technology knowledge), it is always a challenge to present concepts in a way they understand.This set allows us to not only share some basic concepts with kids, but to do it in a way that they absolutely GET it.  There is a teacher's guide (on CD) that tells you exactly how you can prepare and present the concepts.  You are able to plan ahead according to what kind of space you have and how much time you have, and pick one of the activities that is appropriate for your event. You can then set up all of the necessary materials and get the kids into teams, all working on constructing the same thing.  There are four copies of the Exploring Machines Book One, and it's always interesting to see how the teams handle who will be the navigator of the user guide.  It's a marvel to watch because the kids love the K'nex and they really approach it with a sense of fun and frienly competition.Some examples of things you can have them build:- Balance- Block & Tackle- Tow Truck (with working tow cable)- Elevator (when you pull the string, the car in the tower goes up and down via a double pulley system you build)- Paddlewheel boat- Sawmill- Conveyor Belt (my kids LOVE this one)- Rack & Pinion- Transmission (fantastic!)- CraneFor each activity, there are very simple concepts that the guide helps you explain while the kids are hands-on building, even giving you the questions you should ask so they can think these concepts through on their own.  This makes it so easy for us to pass this set around to anyone who is going out on a STEM visit and they need no preparation to be able to pull off a demonstration of:- The mechanical advantage of a block and tackle system- Observe the mechanical advantage of a fixed pulley system- To observe the effect on mechanical advantage when effort force is applied to the small wheel (axle) of a wheel and axle machine- To compare two classifications of inclined planes- To determine mathematically the gear ratio of a model crank fan...and much, much more!  Sample from the teacher's guide:CarouselObjectives-To determine the mechanical advantage of a crown gear system.-To identify simple machines used to transfer input force.Materials-K'NEX Exploring Machines: Carousel modelWhat's the Story?  (Explanation of the model and mechanical concepts)Getting StartedWorksheet (observations and things to think about, plus Challenge questions)You can have four teams put the models together with the 1400 pieces in this set.  The age range listed on Amazon is grades 5 through 9, but if you have more time (and patience!) you can get a bigger range and still keep them interested and learning.  Also, they have other sets for children of other ages, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/K-NEX-Education-Intro-To-Simple-Machines-Gears/dp/B000O910E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>K'NEX Education - Intro To Simple Machines: Gears</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/K-NEX-Education-Simple-Machines-Deluxe-Set/dp/B005Z37NAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>K'NEX Education Simple Machines Deluxe Set</a>.K'nex, just like Lego, are not inexpensive. The joy of K'nex is that they are so different from other building products and more complex.  You may be able to buy a tub of K'nex that has this many pieces for a little less, but the gold in this set is the guides.  It really is difficult to set up learning activities because of all the challenges (how many times have you set up an activity and you get to the end of your time and the kids aren't even close to done?!), and this makes it so easy. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I found this to be a highly educational resource that easily fulfills STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) standards in an incredibly fun way. The level of complexity is perfectly geared towards both my middle school and high school-aged students.There are various activities ranging from the very simple-a hammer, screwdriver or nutcracker to the more complicated chainsaw, paddle boat and carousel...Full-color booklets give clear directions to assemble THIRTY different simple machines listed in color coded categories: Inclined Planes, Levers, Pulleys, Wheels & Axles and Gears.A CD-Rom (both PC and Mac compatible) contains an exceptional teacher's guide that has thorough lesson plans, worksheets and an answer key for fourteen of these machines. There are teaching strategies in addition to Objectives and Materials for each project (Not-so-common items required to supplement projects: Spring Scale, fishing weights and a ping pong ball).Further, the printable worksheets contain charts to input data collected to calculate mechanical advantage, effort force, etc...Questions based on observations can easily stimulate group discussion. Plus, you'll find at least one challenge at the end of each module (the conveyor belt project has four).K'NEX Education provides hours of easily retained learning that transcends book knowledge. The only things I'd change is expanding the teacher's guide to include all the machines, have a bigger plastic case for the set and to provide a parts list to quickly identify if all pieces are included (In my case: I received only one Book #2 and four Book #1's!). Still, this is an amazing set-highly recommended! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I have taught science to fifth graders through college.  This set is marketed for age 8 and up on this Amazon site but as 14 and up on K'nex.  K'nex is correct,  only exceptionally patient and skilled  younger kids would manage this particular set. I have used these K'nex very successfully for high school and college students.  Middle school depends on the students, some do very well, others have a hard time following the directions.  I note that the classroom range is listed at 5th-9th grade.  I would say only gifted and patient 5th graders, but would extend the range up to at least college freshmen.  10th-12th graders would actually do very well with this set.I would not suggest this specific set for an individual child.  Since many of the parts are identical, for your money you could get a larger selection of different parts by buying less specific sets.This set has a LOT of K'nex .  The models start out fairly simple,  with a hammer, and progress to quite complex, a model of a transmission!There are 5 full color instruction books included (3 of Book 1 (54 pages) and 2 of Book 2 (35 pages)),  each in this set.  The teacher instructions suggest laminating them, that would be a good idea. It would be better if they had done so though.  The following are included in the instructions:Levers Section:  Hammer, Balance, Nutcracker (does not crack nuts)Pulleys Section: Tow truck, Block and Tackle, ElevatorWheels and Axles:  Screwdriver, Paddlewheel boat, sawmillInclined Planes: Dump Truck,  Archimedes ScrewGears: Conveyor Belt, Rack and Pinion,  Crank Fan, Carousel, TransmissionBook 2:Pulleys: Garage door and craneWheels and axles: wrench and nutInclined planes Spiral Staircase, AxeGearsChain SawEggbeaterThe directions in this set are less opened ended than in some other educational sets,  due partially to the complexity of the models.  However,  the author does a good job of including higher order thinking skills and in providing actually experiments to do with the completed machines.  A word of warning, these sort of labs take a long time, but the time is not wasted . Students are engaged in actually DOING science, rather than following some recipe.  For higher level thinkers  who stay on task I actually completely abandon the worksheets and tell them to design a say a balance and test it.  It is not uncommon for this sort of approach to take up an hour and half of class time,  not including discussion! However, if time is very tight in your class, using the provided lab outlines would provide enough structure to make certain that the students are progressing and will ensure that there are enough K'nex parts for each group.  In the past I have simply bought the K'nex parts via retail (they are fully compatible with the educational versions).  You can order replacement parts but I have actually found that I can often get the pieces I need more cheaply by scrounging  from other sets.  What I do really like about these educational sets is that there are enough parts to build multiple of the same model at a time for direct comparison.  K'nex parts are pretty sturdy, and I rarely have students break them.Five building books of instructions are supplied.  I would suggest groups of 2-3 ideally, but 4 at the maximum, otherwise some students simply stand around and watch.  So for a large class you will need more than one kit.The set specifies that you can organize the parts, but the case itself does not actually have any dividers, which is strange as the bottom was clearly designed to accept movable dividers.A general statement about various building sets and classroom use:I have used both Lego educational products and K'nex in my science and math classrooms.  My general preference is for K'nex for middle school and up and Lego for elementary school (with the exception of the MindStorms Lego sets which are excellent for computer programing at the high school level).  This is actually based on the physical difficulty of assembling K'nex vs Lego, which is probably why K'nex is marketed as age 10 and up.  K'nex takes more physical force and dexterity to assemble, but the type, size and physical integrity of the of structures are much better with K'nex.  One can build very large structures with K'nex (such as meter long bridges,  meter high roller coasters and so on) that are precluded by the weight of the bricks for Lego.K'nex lends itself far better to engineering and physics problems as it is much sturdier (although not a sturdy as Erector sets!) and one can build cars and structures that will hold together throughout testing.  For physics and engineering projects (motion, machines, conservation of energy, structure building) K'nex is clearly better than Lego.  I also use K'nex in my math classes when I need to show 3D structure.  As a teacher you can register on the K'nex education site and receive access to lesson plans which are linked to the Common Core Standards.  This is quite useful. [SEP]","[CLS] Investigate simple machines through hands-on learning with the K'NEX Education Exploring Machines set! Designed to expand upon a middle school student's knowledge of simple machine concepts, this set provides instructional models for students in 5th through 9th grade to investigate, explore and experiment with. This K'NEX Education Set includes 1,432 K'NEX parts, building instructions, and a comprehensive Teacher's Guide CD, all packaged in a strong plastic tray with a snap-on lid for easy classroom storage. There's enough parts to build 30 fully-functioning replicas of real world machines up to four at a time, and it supports 8-12 students working in teams. The Teacher's guide includes Student Inquiry Sheets and Worksheets for the included models. Student Worksheets ask questions about the machine being investigated and present challenges that can be used to help students think more deeply about the concepts involved and to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information. This set is aligned to STEM standards. STEM Education focuses on science, technology, engineering and mathematics concepts taught through problem-solving, discovery, exploratory learning and critical thinking. STEM Education requires students to be active participants in the learning process. K'NEX models offer hands-on opportunities that encourage scientific inquiry, investigation and experimentation. Our inquiry-based lessons challenge students as they build, investigate, problem solve, discuss, and evaluate scientific and design principles in action.

She was not able to complete the first project she tried, but came close. With a little help she finished the project and was happy. The instructions are good. She was just old enough to connect the pieces together although she had to strain. The use of gears in the design was interesting to her and to me. I believe that the set is worth the money I spent and I expect that it will last a long time.one month update: My granddaughter and I have made three of the machines: a fan, a car window, and a staionary bike. In each case she worked alone and in each case she made a small mistake that kept the project from working. It was not so easy to find the proper solution, but working together we did. I think this is a great set, but it will be a challenge for the younger ages.It is now eight months since I wrote this review and we have completed the seven projects.

I'm sure this worm will get plenty of use around here!**Update: My daughter is now 5 and my oldest son is now 3.5. They still love this toy. The inchworm is perfect, specifically for my daredevil son. The main advantage of the inchworm is that he does not move backwards. So, when they are rolling him up a hill, he doesn't accidentally roll backwards down the hill. Also, there is no steering. Which is perfect because when they ride him down our hill, they can't turn the steering wheel and make him tip. I will warn you, this thing will FLY down a hill. My son thinks it is the best thing ever. The inchworm is, by far, his favorite outdoor riding toy. After a million trips up and down the hill, I can say the inchworm has held up very well. Of course, my son's use of the inchworm is a bit off label, but kids never really play with toys how they were intended. Both he and my daughter can make it inch forward, but that mode of transportation is far too slow for my son's taste.

I'm not sure how educational the book is, but he does have a lot of fun with it. He also loves pressing the nose of the bookworm that lights up. All in all, a fun toy for my son. He still plays with it at 19 months. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This book is far from cardstock. It is heavy plastic and holds up well! I didn't experience any peeling of stickers and I cleaned it with lysol wipes often. The kids all loved it from 6 months even up to 4 years. It is a great little laugh & learn toy and well worth the small price tag. One thing with laugh and learn toys is that don't be so quick to get rid of them if they aren't interested... put it away for 6 months and try again you would be surprised how things change!

Cardstock.  That's not very baby friendly.Vtech on the other hand has a nursery rhymes book (same concept, plastic musical light up pages) but their books illustrations were printed on high gloss stickers thus they are easy to wipe off and the pages don't run the risk of being torn, etc.Great idea but done better by others.

The quality is fine as I've come to expect and it is a good size with ample room for a man's hand. In fact, it might be too large for children and some women as it's difficult to move both mouth and arms. It seems to be an either/or proposition.  My one disappointment is that the plastic teeth seem flattened/packed down and don't look as if they'll ever stand. Other than that a delight I expect to use for many years in children's ministry.

B000OKW1DU,"[CLS] Its okay, sounds more fun than it actually is to play. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We bought this for our daughter for Christmas. We have been playing it for a little while now and think it is great. My 7 year old loves it, so does my 5 year old. They can play together or alone. It has held up well and is great for the fast thinking skill. All you need to know is your colors and have a fast hand to get the color there when asked. Me and my husband have also taken it out when the kids are in bed and have had a few good battles our selves:) [SEP]"",""[CLS] Picked this up for my 6 year old for Christmas and it's really fun.  Plays as it is described and plays well.  Starting games up is easy and the build seems solid enough.  The rubber band does a surprisingly good job of returning the discs in single player games, making single player games more fun that I expected.  The two player mode is probably the most fun since it's head to head, but it can be pretty addictive to play in single player mode to try to beat your own high score.  Gameplay is fast - this is mainly about being able to accurately identify the right colored piece quickly enough to slide it before getting buzzed.  The low end of the suggested age range on Amazon for this game is 6 years, and though my 6 year old likes it he is just not fast & coordinated enough to get very far - in head to head mode with another player or in the single player games.  Hopefully he'll grow into it and keep at it, because it really is fun - just a little too fast for the younger kids.  For older kids & adults, it's a blast. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a fantastic game to play by yourself or with friends!  I like the three different variations.  I'm not very good at the Code Breaker but the other two are very fun.  Add One reminds me of the game simon where you had to press whatever colors lit up.  Good memory game for kids or adults.  Fast Pass it fun though if you're like me and sometimes slide the discs too enthusiastically then it can keep you from getting a high score (hard to get when you have to pause to fetch a wayward disc). [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this on a whim on black friday for my son. i saw it was for 8+ but i got such a good deal i figured if it didn't work out not too much lost but fortunately he loves it. the first one i bought however didn't work properly. the blue disc didn't register when you slid it under but after exhanging it the new one works fine. so hold onto your receipt just in case. the unit stores the 4 discs in a panel that slides off on the side(the black part)so you won't lose any pieces when you are not playing. there's even an elastic band you can place under the unit that allows you to play by yourself. the band bounces the disc back to the single player which i thought was a very nice touch. there are 5 different games you can play. the first one you try to slide as many correct discs as possible in sixty seconds. the second is the same as the first but must be played with two players. the first player to score 3 points wins and you win by correctly sliding the discs the game designates to each player. the third is called add one and with each pass the game will add another color to a growing sequence(think of simon says; red, blue, green, blue, red, red), the fourth is the same as the second but with a growing sequence. and the last one is called code buster and you have to decipher a code secretly determined by the game.all in all i think this game is very well thought out and real fun for almost anyone. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Base houses small pieces so I just have to toss the unit in the closet without worrying where the pieces went. Fun for all ages. [SEP]"",""[CLS] After my 5 year old son requested this game I did my research and found that most small children enjoy it as well.  I found this to be true.  It is fast paced and took some getting used to due to his age, he has enjoyed it the challenge.  It is like a puzzle in that you have to figure out which colors need to be passed through, you have to memorize the ones that are right and then figure what is next with a time going at the same time.  You can play one player or two.  My son is having to think quick on his toes and how good is that for him!  By the way they make a ball just like it called nerf cosmic keep away electronic game and up to six players can play.  We have both of these games and love them. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Although the age range for this one is noted as being for ages eight and up, I can personally testify to the fact that teens also find the Hyper Slide to be fun and challenging.  It comes equipped with five games and my son and a group of his friends spent hours in our living room, the only room with a roaring fire and some warmth, playing this game. They were laughing and cheering each other on in their attempt to slide the various colors of pucks or little chips under the arch of hyper slide - as soon as the recorded voice of the game leader told them which colored chip to select.  What is particularly clever about the Hyper Slide is its single player option. To use it for solo players, you simply take a rubber strip and insert it into the appropriate parts of the arch, converting it instantly from a 2 person game to one for an individual player. Very smart!  THere are five games of varying difficulty. The most challenging for our family was the one where a pattern of colors would be noted (red, yellow, yellow would be one example) and then an ADDITIONAL color would be added to that pattern so that the player would have to remember an increasing number of chips to slide through the arch, all in a given time limit. Try it and see how hard it can be.  Because of the different levels of difficulty, I have to rate this one high. It held our teen's attention - and those of his friends - for most of a day and has continued to be popular.

B000OOLNTY,"[CLS] The electronic edition is very fun.Since money and assets are keptdigitally, it is a time saver. Great forfamily game night! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My niece has this game and I've played it with her several times each taking turns with who get's to be the banker and although it is alot easier than counting paper money ... it can get quite tedious constantly placing the plastic money cards into the + slot and - slot each time for each player. If they created something like an ATM like thing where you slide your card and press deposit or withdraw with one card slide it'd be alot better. But it is a BIG improvement from the paper money. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this game for my two younger sisters for Christmas since I grew up playing Monopoly and thought they would enjoy having their own copy of the game. We played this Christmas day and the day after, and I have to say I wasn't very impressed. Here is why:1) The assumed value of an electronic banking system is that it would speed up the game vs. transferring paper money back and forth. In reality, this isn't the case. Loading the plastic debit cards each time you want to do a transaction takes 2-3x longer than just handing over paper money.2) Everything in the game is branded. This isn't really 'modern' Monopoly. It's 'licensed' Monopoly. Most of the properties are tourist attractions or MLB ballparks. The continuity of the old version (which is based on famous streets) just isn't there.3) Changing the prices by a factor of 10k seems like a nice way to update the game, but in reality it is unnecessary since the prices are all just arbitrary anyway. It makes certain things a real pain in the neck (for example: figuring out 10% taxes when properties are valued at x.xx millions--adding them up is a lot more complicated than it used to be; 2nd example: figuring out how much Street Repairs should be OR how much the 10% surcharge is for un-mortgaging properties).4) End game scenarios such as trading properties for rent, selling properties in combination, etc, are all much more complicated when dealing with decimal numbers. Not impossible, but harder for your average 7-10 year old for sure. It was a good opportunity to talk about how decimal numbers work, so from a learning perspective it could be a plus.There are a few changes I do like:1) Updated pieces including fun things like a Space Shuttle, a ball-cap, etc... This is the sort of update that is well worth it (seriously who wants to be the anvil from the old game much less the iron?)2) Instantly knowing exactly how much money you have. (You can put your debit card into the card reader at any point and it will tell you your existing balance).Conclusions:The electronic banking edition of Monopoly will not speed up your games. If that's your motivation, skip it because chances are it will end up taking longer! If you want a cool new Monopoly with interesting new properties, again this one isn't that impressive (seriously, Jacobs Field? Charging rent for the White House?). I'd rather they'd chosen actually properties or streets The Chicago Monopoly edition for example is very cool--especially for those who live in Chicagoland! It ended up feeling like the electronic banking option, while a good idea in theory, didn't really add much to the game. That said, Monopoly is still a pretty entertaining family game to play with a mix of kids & adults, and this version is no exception. I just think there are better versions out there.2.5/5 Stars. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this for my son's 7th birthday, and we had a blast playing it.  He had played Monopoly Jr. before, but never real Monopoly, and he loved it.  I like that it sort of gives kids the whole concept of a debit card.  My husband was banker, and although it seemed cumbersome to have the credit tracking system, he said he much preferred it over paper money.  The only thing I didn't like was that without paper money, you have to keep asking the banker what your balance is because you can't get an idea of what your worth is without the paper money in front of you.  It is kind of interesting to play with such high value properties, too, after playing the classic game for so many years.  We liked the cool, modern playing pieces.  Fun was had by all!  :) [SEP]",[CLS] Now players can experience the most current version of Monopoly with an electronic banking unit instead of cash.

They are: Light Speed, Rapid Recharge, Pattern Panic, Cube Catcher, Code Cracker and Multiplayer Madness. I like Light Speed and Cube Catcher the best.Multiplayer Madness has more than 2 players to play on it, and you have to pass the cube to the next player to see if they can get the light of the cube before the timer buzzes and forces that player out of the game. Light Speed is where you punch in the light that is lighted up at a time before the buzzer sounds, and it gets faster and faster as you go. Cube Catcher is where you have to get the light at a percentage of 70% or more to go to the next level.This is amazing fun for the whole family and it doesn't take long at all to learn it. Kids of all ages can learn it and it is great fun on long trips.

I had not seen something like this in a long time since the original Rubik's Cube came out in the 1970s to 1980s.  This one is unique in the aspect that it has a timer on each of the games and has you race to beat the clock on Rapid Recharge and other games.  It has 6 games to challenge yourself on and it is very fun to learn and to play.Not recommended for on the airplane, but recommended for in the car on long trips or at parties and family gatherings.Very good fun and easy to learn.  Recommended highly! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Most people are familiar with the Rubik's Cube, where by twisting the squares they become mixed up and become a very difficult challenge to put back in proper order. However;Rubik's Revolution is a completely different type of a cube. None of thesquares move at all. The center of each side is indented and has a square that can pe pushed in. This cube is electronic and the center squares can light up;and by pressing the lit square,it goes out,and a different center square lights up. This is all done by an internal electronic program. The cube makes sounds when a square is lit or extinguished.There are 6 different types of games programmed into the cube. Also a time limit is announced at the start of the game and your score(number of squares you extinguish) is announced at the end of each game. Each of the 6 sides of the cube is a different game. It is very simple to learn how to play the games,and takes only a couple of minutes.. So ;what this cube really is ,is something to challenge your eye and hand coordination,agility and speed. It can be enjoyed by children or adults. The more one plays with it;the better one gets at locating the lit square,and extinguishing it;and seeing how much better scores you can make. One can play alone,trying to get better scores,pass it to others to see who can get better scores,or even have several people,each with a cube,competing with one another. It is a real entertaining challenge. A lot of Reviews have rated it poorly,because it is not the more familiar cube;but forget about that;as it is completely different. There are a lot of other comments criticizing the quality,stickers falling off,etc.;but I find mine to be well made and problem free. Another important thing about this product ,and where it differs from the conventional Rubik's Cube is that it won't be put aside by most people who feel the conventional cube is too hard for them to solve. Everyone will want to give it a try. If you happen to find the cube and there are no instructions on how to start it up,there is a small on/off swiths on one of the corner squares on the red squares side.

It's mostly about trying to beat the clock and develop quick reflexes so that you can press the right buttons and turn off flashing lights fast enough so that the cube doesn't turn itself off and make an irritating ehh-ehh-ehh beeping sound.I think you can ignore most of the negative reviews this has gotten on Amazon -- they mostly seem to be from avid fans of the old, original Rubik's Cube who didn't understand that this is a different toy, and somehow feel cheated that the Rubik brand has been used for a new purpose. But if they had read the packaging or tried the toy out in the store they would have known this is a different product altogether and maybe not got so upset.

The box comes with a ton of pieces to color and a set of pencils for coloring. There is no right or wrong way to color them, it is entirely up to the child (or adult if you can convince your kids to give you any :P).Once they are colored, you just pop them in an oven and watch carefully. We use our toaster oven so we can keep a close eye on them through the window. The instructions clearly state to wait until they curl up and then lay flat again.Take them out and viola - a fun little piece of art.I think they are a doubly fun craft kit because kids get to color and design and then they get to see a little oven magic.The pieces hold up but there are so many that if you break one or lose one, there are no tears.A great way to pass the time on a rainy afternoon or cold winter day and fun for many ages (if I could only get my kids to share with me...)

B000P7MALK,"[CLS] I bought this because the bears alone make the price a value. They are sold separately for about the same price. They can be used for so many things: matching, sorting, counting, basic math, etc. Add the scale to demonstrate greater than/less than/equal concepts, and science concepts, this is a great tool! Love it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Another great Learning Resources product!  I purchased this with the hopes of avoiding purchasing the 3 Bear Family counters separately...  That doesn't work...  I purchased the pattern cards, and had intended on using the bears that came with this for those, but I didn't read carefully enough, apparently.  The pattern cards require Mom, Dad, and Baby bears, so if you intend to avoid purchasing the others, it really doesn't work very well.As far as the scales--Fantastic!  They are of really nice quality, and are a great visual aid, and a really nice introduction to weights, and measurement.  They have spouts, so that you can easily weigh different liquids, and have platforms that fit on top of the containers for smaller items.  If I were to complain about anything, it would be those: the platforms do not attach to the containers very well, and fall off rather easily.  I found out once I purchased it that my kids may still be a bit young for it (2 and 4,) but it will be invaluable for years to come.  We will be able to compare the weights of many different items for a very, very reasonable price. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I've really enjoyed watching my kids play with this bear balance set. They enjoy weighing the bears against various household items, and I like that, with the buckets, they can even weigh liquids. It's a great way to introduce kids to weights and balances! [SEP]"",""[CLS] We got this more just for fun and play than anything, which is really how kids learn best. We also got the weight set to go with it as well. My main complaint is storing it. It's really difficult to get it all back into the box properly to store it. But nonetheless the kids enjoy playing with it and exploring weights and measurements and all sorts of other concepts with this. I believe in learning through play and activities more than workbooks and worksheets and so far it has proven true for my kids through our homeschooling journey thus far. The bears can also be used for sorting and counting and other fun activities so this set really gives you a lot of resources and opportunities for exploring different concepts. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Look forward to using with 3-4 year olds in preschool like setting. Seems sturdy.  We have not tried it yet, as we slowly introduce new things.  But I think we will get a great deal or learning fun out of it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] So out of the blue, my 5 year old daughter asked for a scale for Christmas.  She wanted to weigh things and she described comparing weights of different objects, so it sounded like a balancing scale would probably be the best bet.  I shopped around and this scale seemed like a good product, with the understanding that toy scales aren't perfect.  The nice thing is that it also included a bunch of weights in the shape of colored teddy bears, that can be used to measure the weight of an object.  It comes with 102 bears that are 4 grams each.  You could buy a different scale, but once you add in the weights, this combo balance scale set ended up being a good value.I debated as to what style to buy.  There were several types including the scales with hanging pans (picture the scales of justice), scales with buckets and scales with flat surfaces.  I immediately ruled out any scales with hanging pans.  The strings that would hold the pans would get in the way of any tall items, really limiting what you could weigh.  I settled on this set because the scale not only had nice buckets, but it also had covers for the buckets that would create a flat surface to place an item on.  Really, the best of both worlds.  My daughter had lots of fun weighing various items and princess figurines against each other and with the bear weights.  The set also has a storage drawer for the bear weights and adjustment sliders to adjust the balance.  The only negative is that the buckets aren't perfectly equal in weight which means you need to adjust the sliders to get the starting point to be level and we can't quite get them perfect, so it gets a star knocked off for this slight quality issue.Overall, this scale turned out to be perfect for her because it doesn't have to be precise, just fun.  You get both a bucket and a flat surface to place items on without any strings to get in the way, and you get included weights making this balance set a great value.  If you are looking for a fun little kid's scale, this one is a good choice.

B000PEHDFG,"[CLS] My boys love this! Can't go.wrong with tonka [SEP]"",""[CLS] My child LOVES her Tonka Classic Steel Mighty Dump Truck! Though, I have to say the quality is still not nearly as amazing as the one I had as a child, but still better than other trucks you might find on the market today. My child loves to drive this truck all over our house and it hold's her toys! The wheels, bumper, and underside of the truck are ALL plastic. Though, Tonka still does a nice classic truck! [SEP]"",""[CLS] As described. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a toy I bought to start working on a multi-action functional play sequence with my son, who has some developmental delays.  That's going to be a longer process that he's currently not feeling like he cares about, but what I am appreciating about this is that the truck bed is metal and sturdier.  Because my little guy also doesn't care about trying to work on upper body strength the way his occupational therapist has currently asked us to do, but we're totally still trying I promise :), and even with the most powerful of his ABA reinforcers, he will only move a laundry basket with stuff in it a maximum of 8 inches.  He's strong enough to pull it across the room. So, as I was watching him line up my dumbbells the other day on the floor, I had this idea to try a DIR Floortime approach to start working on similar strength concepts in a way he might find more motivating.  So I've been loading dumbbells up into this, rolling the truck to him, he unloads one and pushes it back to me, I push it back, and so forth until he unloads them all and puts them in his line up.  I let him keep his line for a bit, then I load up dumbbells, lather, rinse, repeat so to speak.  And he likes that one enough not a single reinforcer required.  So from my perspective, these seem sturdy enough, despite the plastic components underneath the metal truck bed.  Despite the use of weights, my son isn't probably going to be the type to give himself a ride on one of these, or play super rough with it, because car and truck play in general isn't as motivating to him as being chased, so if you have a kiddo that wants to sit on these and scoot across the floor, maybe the plastic part would be a problem.  Or if he/she is into pounding on these types of things with hard tools, or if it's going to be left outside where the sun could damage the plastic...  Otherwise, I don't see any reason to be  concerned about the plastic, and I love that the metal bed makes it tough enough to send some dumbbells across the room without showing signs of stress to the toy.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] I used to use an Uncle Milton Digital TV Microscope in my classes at school. We would use it look closely at various sample of items we studied in Science (like rocks, minerals, fingerprints, plants, etc.).I recently bought an EyeClops and I was blown away. It works SOOOOOO much better than the digital TV microscope. Images with the EyeClops were, without a doubt, ,so much clearer than they were with the otehr microscope. I'm not sure if it is because more lights used with the EyeClops or not. We have looked at so many other things now in class with our EyeClops - skin, hair, and - our favorite - cuts on hands and arms - the kids love seeing these blown up 200 times larger than they are.The price is also very reasonable - I paid around $40 for the EyeClops and I paid close to $70 for the inferior Uncle Milton product.I have already recommended that every grade level in our school should have one of these ready to use! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I purchased this for my son last Christmas (I paid around 40.00 new for it on Amazon, but noticed the price has doubled). We can great fun with it until the next day it broke. I know things happen such as this, and it was probably just bad luck for me---but I would not advise paying more than $20.00 for this. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I had originally intended on getting my 9 year old son a microscope for Christmas last year, but this was new and the hot new toy so I decided to try this instead.  I wish I hadn't.  Firstly, you plug it into your tv, fine.  But that means bringing anything you want to look at to your tv as well, also not a huge deal but something we didn't really consider before purchasing and it can be a hassle if he wants to look at bugs or something.  Also you have to be pretty much on whatever you want to see for the lens to even notice it.  The slightest distance away and it might as well be invisable.  It's made durable enough, but could have been better.  My biggest complain would just have to be not being able to see much with it.  The most fun we had was touching it to our skin and hair and looking at that magnified, everything else was lame. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I was very disapointed with this toy. My grand child was bored with it very quickly. It can be improved, and made with more options. It was way overpriced, for what you get! Would not recomend, unless they improve on the design. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Grampa gave the 12-year-old son this very cool microscope toy for Christmas. Big hit! It's easy to use with amazingly clear, sharp and bright full-color magnification. 200x is very strong -- don't do your carpet if you don't think you can stand seeing what's really there, even after you've vacuumed! Hours of creative play? Yeah, probably - and it's easy to just unplug and store in a toy drawer until next time. We love this thing. A+ [SEP]"",""[CLS] My mother got this for my 4.5 year old this year on my recommendation. I am very impressed.The design is simple. The eyeclops unit has the eye, a brain power pack which takes 5 AA batteries, and a cord which plugs into the yellow composite input on your TV, all connected (the cord doesn't come off, so it can't be lost). The white part of the eye - the iris they call it, screws on and off of the unit itself, allowing you to adjust the focal length of whatever you are putting the eyeclops up against. The idea is that you put the eyeclops in direct contact with what you want to look at and adjust the iris to focus it. It also comes with a petrie style dish and a tube you can use to look at liquids and other messy things.The picture is amazing for a gadget like this. I hooked it up to my 1080p 52 HDTV and was very happy with the images, though that size TV is perhaps slightly large for the resolution it outputs, its certainly quite viewable. It looks equally cool on my 32 CRT.Operationally speaking, its easy to use, there is only one button - on/off, but it does take a gentle touch to find the right distance for the camera to focus, as it has a fixed focal length. However, as an adult I had no problem doing this, my 4.5 year old does not have the fine motor skills to do this well, however, from the look on her face and the long list of things she keeps bringing to look at it, its not a big deal that she needs my help with it. If you do buy this for a preschooler, be prepared to play cameraman.Technicalities out of the way, the concept is soooo cool. I played with it for 2 hours by myself when I first hooked it up! The magnification is amazing, I can see individual hairs on my cheek, fibers on my arm I can't tell are there, the individual fibers (not threads) that make up my sofa, etc. A great tool for talking to the kids about how things are made up, and to allow them to explore their world. My childhood self is seriously jealous. We have had a blast finding different things to look at and my 2 year old now says 'Ew GROOOOOSSSS!' every time.I uploaded some pictures to check out.UPDATE - 4 years later - while this isn't a toy we play with constantly, it is still something my kids at 6 and 8 enjoy using, as they get older with a different perspective.

It comes with a pietre (sp?) dish and a clear cylindrical container that they can put smaller objects in to view.  My boys put salt, snow, and dirt in right away.  They had no problem focusing the objects, as some other reviewers have had.  It is very durable as well.  My son dropped it from about 5 feet up and I feared that it was broken for sure - but it isn't!  We live in a small scientific town and they constantly receive educational kits and toys as gifts.  This is the only one that they have ever been completely fascinated by!

But it gets VERY warm inside, even with the flaps open. It made my son wake up periodically throughout the night to take his PJ's off. From my son's perspective, he liked it but was too rough on it. Eventually I took it off his bed completely before he could destroy it. The material is pretty flimsy, and the fit over his mattress was not tight so it shifted quite a bit. We'll use it on the floor for a fun tent instead. I gave this 3 stars because of the heat issue - it seriously gets very warm inside - and also because of the way the flaps are pulled back. The velcro hooks are near the bottom, allowing the panels to fall, basically they might as well be shut at that point.Also - the treehouse theme is lost on my 4 year old. He has no idea really what that is, I wish there had been some other design options.But my remorse (nothing to do with the stars given) also includes the fact that I can't just sit on the edge of his bed and talk to him; I can't lay with him and rub his back. We can't sit together and read a book as he gets comfy for sleep. Those are big reasons I don't like this. Just including these thoughts for anyone that might read this.

This requires quite a bit of underside whacking and pulling from the top to free them. This hasn't however caused any major frustration on my little man's part. (I think in time the holes will increase slighlty in size) It also would have been nice to have had a few more pieces in the set ie. nuts, bolts and brackets or even the opportunity to buy an add on set.  Other than that I'm very pleased with it and it's gets quite a lot of play in our house.  A good toy to improve a child's dexterity, patience and also a bit of cause and effect.~ UPDATE:-  If you are looking for Extra nuts & bolts etc consider ordering a Melissa & Doug Take a long Tool kit.  All the bits fit this work bench!  The Melissa & Doug kit is no where near as good as this for actually hammering bits into it, it doesn't turn over only onto it's side, but it makes a great carry case for all the tools and then all the bolts for both sets fit nicely into this work bench. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This toy is ok.  The hammer broke and we needed to glue it, but didn't solve the issue.  Also,  the sides of the toolbox came off and needed to be glued.  If child hammers the nails in to far, you will need a Real hammer to get them out.  The one it comes with won't do the job. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I don't like this toy that much. Its because of the combination of its expensive price tag plus its not up to the par quality. The hammer head has come off its shaft. The nuts do not easily screw in or out. This toy overall is not very playable. It looks good in photos and that's about it. I don't recommend this. You will get much better workbench like toys in Ikea. [SEP]"",""[CLS] In my opinion, this is the best toolbox toy on the market. Here's why:* Nice selection of pieces: screws, bolts, nuts, nails, hammer, wrench, screwdriver, wood vise/clamp and the combo toolbox/workbench.* Very nice quality: everything seems sturdy and built to last - even the plastic pieces (nails, wrench head).* Combo toolbox/workbench: not only do you get a little box to hold the tools, but it flips over into a very usable work bench!* Threaded screw holes: the Melissa and Doug sets ONLY have smooth holes on the toolbox itself. So, to use the screws/bolts with those sets, you have to hold a nut in place behind the hole, then screw into it - which is VERY hard for a toddler. This set has nice threaded holes, so you can screw right into them!* It's very cuteThe only small negatives (would have been a 5-star rating otherwise):* The little wood vise/clamp doesn't really work very well. Yes, I know it's just a toy, but if you're going to put the vise/clamp there, it should work. As it is, when you tighten it down on something, the construction of it is a little loose and it just doesn't hold anything enough to work on it. (Maybe I got a faulty one? I dunno.)* The packaging looks cheap, and the wording on the packaging is poorly translated.Overall, this toolbox toy is highly recommended!

I have uploaded an actual picture in the customer photos section so that you can see for yourself.  Out of 15 nozzles, only about three of them spray anything worth playing in.  The rest lay limp on the ground or spray maybe 6 of water, at best.  The item is poorly made and lacks the weight to keep the nozzles upright.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] LIKE [SEP]"",""[CLS] These watercolors are made by the same company that manufactures the Ticonderoga pencils, Prang.The school my daughters attend ask for these paints by name, specifically, each year because of their consistency and quality.A solid purchase for back-to-school needs. [SEP]"",""[CLS] As an independent art teacher who has taught primarily preschool though elementary school, I have tried a HUGE variety of washable pan sets.  I always felt that if you give a child a good quality material, they will produce good quality art. I spent a good 15 years researching and trying all kinds of art materials in my classrooms, and I can say that the Prang washable watercolor sets are by far the superior choice.  One may think that Crayola would be better, but NO!  Markers and crayons, yes.  But Prang wins this one, and it is all that I ever bought for my students.  They are semi-moist, which means that they are a little sticky, but it also means that you do not have to work so hard to get the paint flowing.  A little water, and gentle swirls, and you will get beautiful, bold colors fast!  You do need to  teach your children not to gauge, or scoop the paint, as they always try and do this at first, and it is important to also watch that they keep enough water going into the colors or they do get sticky. Prangs colors are have beautiful, smooth pigment quality that can easily be manipulated to be very dark(almost opaque) or very light depending on how much water you use. I used them for all kinds of projects on paper and wood with wonderful results.  If you are doing crayon or oil pastel relief you want to make sure that they use plenty of water, because as I mentioned they are quite powerful when applied heavily, and will cover their lines and you won't get that pop  of a relief effect.  Overall, I'd rather have to guide my children/students a bit more and achieve a better result. Art is not just a hobby, and children should be taught how to properly use materials. I found that all of the other brands of watercolor pan sets in this price range were always thin and lifeless, and pail in comparison to the bold and lively color you get from Prang watercolors.  BTW...you can find them cheaper in many places, even Staples.  Cheapest price is always Discount School Supply. [SEP]","[CLS] Praying washable watercolor set 16 pan.

While this hasn't engaged him like we'd hoped, he's nevertheless enjoyed listening to it, and *I've* had fun playing it.The sound is great! I also like the coloring on the different bars which helps you figure out where the octave starts and ends. It comes with a small song-book with many simple songs / nursury rhyme tunes, and color-coded music which you can play by reading the notes or just looking at the color.It comes with two hammers (things to play notes with), thin wooden rods with a round wooden ball glued on the end. These tuck into a small tube on either side of the glockenspiel.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] Three of these Color Explosion boards arrived under our Christmas tree in 2010.  My children (almost 5 twins, almost 7 boy) were so excited to try out the glow boards and make new designs!  The kits starts out amazing, with a nice set of colored markers, space-themed gel clings, and some paper tracing images.  The board works great, but the markers dry out very easily and it is really difficult to completely clean the board off to make room for a new drawing.  Also, there is no real storage area for the paper scenes and gel clings, and in our house the two items mixed and the gel clings made big grease stains on the paper images.  The fun factor ran out quickly for this toy at our house.  My kids were frustrated because they couldn't get the board clean enough for another picture, and some markers stopped working quickly after the set was opened.  Overall, this is a creative toy but it has some definite drawbacks.  FYI:  You cannot buy replacement markers for this set at the store - you will need to order them online at Amazon or Crayola.

The cookie cutters are great.  Oddly enough, this should really come with instructions (as I've seen others point out).  I finally figured out the ruler with shapes in it actually slides over the red tube.  The 4 orange pieces are completely useless.  I threw them away.

B000RPZV3E,"[CLS] The new version with 11 animals was blah and unexciting.  All the animals were the same color and just did not stand out in any way.  I searched really hard and found the original version with the explorer.  These animals were painted differently and looked much better.  However, neither version really painted the diamond backs on the rattlesnake.I bought this set for use in sorting desert animals.  All of these animals are from North America, though scorpions are found nearly everywhere.  The set includes: scorpion, roadrunner, coyote, armadillo, bobcat, mountain lion/puma/cougar, saguaro, horntoad, big horn sheep, rattle snake (mine looked like the Arizona black rattlesnake but poorly painted diamonds on the back), and prairie dog.

Concepts are so much easier for them to grasp if they can hold and play with the animals they're leaning about, rather than just reading about them in a book. The animals are well crafted, the pieces have been nicely painted and they're fairly detailed which helps them look more realistic - the snake has scales, the birds have feathers, and the armadillo has plates of armor. They also have their names on the underside in case you need help identifying what they are. Most of the pieces in this set stand up on their own fairly well, although some are a little wobbly.The only thing I find a little cumbersome is the tube itself. While it's great for storing, it's compact size and odd shape makes it difficult to get the animals in and out - the rope handle also seems to get in the way. Other than the somewhat troublesome tube, the animals in this set are great and I will definitely be buying more of these collections.

Having spent a wonderful day together we planned to make one last stop at the Penguin Encounter, get my face painted like a marine animal and then go see one of her friends to get her a new tattoo.Upon entering the exhibit, we wandered apart looking at the various sights. When I realized that she was nowhere to be found I started to worry where she might be. Further compounding the situation, I needed to go to the bathroom. With no bathroom in sight and the growing sense of urgency to pee further decreased my rational thought.Being in a darkened exhibit area, I saw a door light up the immediate surrounding area as it opened and closed quickly from one of the SeaWorld employees exiting. Without delay, I went towards the door, opened it and entered the long corridor. Hustling down the path looking to and fro frantically searching for a restroom or at least an employee who could direct me to one.As my pace increased in the well-lit steryl hallway, I found a door partially open with apparent plumbing pipes visible. Thinking it would to lead to a bathroom, I hurried through it and down that cool wet hallway to another door that was opened. Upon entering it, I immediately felt a dramatic drop in the tempreture and realized I had actually entered the area the penguins lived in.The door behind me shut as I turned around to leave. Trying to open the locked door was a futile effort.Hearing a series of slow moving crunch noises, I slowly turned around and saw something more disturbing than a sequel to Happy Feet was a a group of penguins standing upright in the snow towards me.The crunching sound increased as they walked towards me. It was at that point, I lost control of my bladder.To this day, I'm not sure exactly what happened after that. It seems like a blur having only bits here and there with a frenzy of penguins above me as I rolled about on the snow covered ground and frozen cement floor.I do recall coming slowly back to consciousness while being dragged out naked by a couple of guys in arctic gear and then pending a few hours in a medical facility at SeaWorld.The car ride from the park with my mom was a silent one. Neither of of said a word. I remained in the car that evening while she was getting her tattoo.I felt confused, angry and somewhat thrilled by what happened. How was I to ever sort out what had happened.It's been years since that took place. I've had some therapy. My mother went back to prison. However, I have found peace from that life-changing event through my volunteer work at a local aviary cleaning bird cages. It has given me time to reflect and sort out my feelings. As a result, the realization of my strong connection (some say unhealthy attraction) to birds.I picked up this tube of penguins to remind me that life changing moment. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I was not really surprised at the lack of details in the painting of the penguins. Some lack identifying marks. But if these are just for a child to play with then they are O.K.

The feathers are ruffled outward as this male turkey struts his stuff.  And thanks to the wings being extended slightly downwards it's stable too.Cons:  it was hard to find anything I didn't like about this item.  As usual, Safari paints a series of four digits on all their animals.  Luckily for the turkey they chose a discreet color and painted it very small on the back of a single tail feather.  Much less noticeable than my other Safari animals!I wish there were more turkeys so my big beautiful tom could have a family.  Seriously love this guy! [SEP]","[CLS] A Male Turkey is called a Tom.

But, know what you are getting into when you by one of these.First, you'll of course have to get the pet adopted on the Webkinz web site.  Then, you'll have to study the online user manual for the Webkinz web site because unless your child has a certain reading ability, maybe fourth grade, they won't be able to read it all by themselves.Then of course, you'll have to teach your child what you learned.  You might be with your child for a few hours at this site while you both learn your way around.  With a five year old it is going to take a while.  Of course, you may view it as a bonding experience, so it's not all bad, but there is a time commitment you make when you get one of these.Then, you'll have to cope with the technical glitches at the Webkinz web site.  My ordeal was in getting my son's Webkinz husky to send messages and gifts to another Webkinz husky owned by my son's best friend of the same age.  The site has a post office where you can send letters and gifts to a friend on your friend list, but they don't tell you on the site how to get a friend on the friend list, so I had to do research out on the Internet to see how this is done.Once we had mastered that, we found that the mailbox doesn't update with new messages unless you log out of the Webkinz site and log back in again.Some of the navigation controls on the Webkinz site are very narrow and hard for very young children to master because they require a lot of mouse precision.  You may end up sitting with your child at the computer getting them through some of the things they want to do.Finally, your pet's life is one year on the site unless you buy more Webkinz toys or buy a renewal of your pet at the end of one year.  They want to hook you into spending more money.  I'm glad these cute little things don't cost too much.So, now you have an idea of what you are committing to when you buy one of these toys.

The rest of the set includes, two angels, three shepherds, three wise men, two sheep, one camel, one donkey, Mary, Joseph, baby Jesus, a manger and a haystack.  Finally, there is the stable, which is really just the stable front.  Most of the pieces are between 2 and 3 inches high and are made of a type of medium plastic.  The craftsmanship of the set is excellent.  The stable is about 5 inches high at its highest point and is 10 inches wide.  Both my children, ages 6 and 3, love playing with this set.  Although the recommended age range for this product is 8 and up, younger children can appreciate it.  You should be aware that for children younger than 3, the baby Jesus is quite small (approximately 2 L x 1/2 W) and could pose a choking hazard.

I have a canary and have bird seed scattered on the floor.  I take the hose and attachments to get under the furniture.  He does the same and he actually gets some of the seed.  Not a strong suction but it does work enough to make him happy.  When I empty my canister, he has a few bird seeds to empty in the trash also. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Do not waste your money on this.  My son only used it twice before it was broken.  He was so frustrated with it. It is supposed to have suction, but it really doesn't pick up much and you have to be exactly over the area that sucks up.  It really only works with the hose and that isn't what my son wanted.  I am not impressed.  If you have a very young child, 2-3, then it might be OK, but my 6 year old wanted something that actually worked.

The cart itself is much smaller than I was expecting and looks rather small with my fairly petite three year-old pushing it (it's more in scale with my twins, who are now 20 months old). The cart tips over easily and is not durable at all. After a day of use, the metal frame had been bent and I basically had to bend it back out. Probably my biggest complaint about this was assembly. Getting the frame for it together wasn't too bad, but the step of putting the wheels on using these little bolts in the wheels and then pressing the metal rods into them while they lay flat on a hard surface. Basically the metal bends when the rod is pushed through, fastening it there. This required a lot more force than I was expecting, pressing the rods into the bolts on a concrete surface. This should be a consideration, and taking the rest of the package into account, the Casdon Toys Shopping Cart Trolley should probably just be ignored altogether.

The suction cups do a great job keeping it attached to the counter, and I have not once had it come off when I didn't want it to. If you use the enclosed paint, I never have issues with blobs and not being able to achieve the spin art effect. Occasionally, when I am using another brand of paint that is just a little bit thicker, but it is easily solved in one of two ways - spin it again a couple of times (sometimes they can't get full momentum with the first spin, so we usually spin a few times, and at least 2 or so will end up being full speed spins). Secondly, my kids enjoy dripping the paint on as it is moving - this creates a slightly different effect, and is easier to get the spin effect. Another variation my kids enjoy, is dragging a toothpick across the top as it spins to mix the colors and add swirls. We've also used it with markers, instead of the paint. Just hold a marker (lightly) to the paper while it spins.  My kids ages 6, 4 and 2 love playing with this! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Bought for gift. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This concept is good but not practical.

B000VVZ1N4,"[CLS] This poor duck is going to get worn out, because he has been a bunch of places since he arrived 3 days ago.  My daughter is absolutely in love with it!  I am kinda in love with him too.  First and foremost, he is just adorable to look at.  The beaded filling to him gives a nice solid weight to it, but it is also so cuddly and soft to hug close.  The weight is all in the body of it, so the legs / wings / head are pretty much weightless, but I think it just adds to the cuddle factor with him.I read some of the review saying that the duck was over scented or that the smell of the lavender is too strong.  Quick tip: don't put your nose right into his bottom and sniff!  His head isn't scented, so cuddling with him like most kids would, you aren't getting a nose full of the lavender.  Yes, if you really whiff his backside, he does kinda have a strong scent. Just don't sniff the duck's butt and you will be good, ok?When my daughter was only a few months old my mother got a white tiger that is similar. I was kinda skeptical over it, until we got a really cold snap.  Being able to warm up her crib with a warm stuffed animal to place next to her as a warm body helped her transfer and sleep so much calmer.  When my daughter got her first ear infection her snow tiger got a work out!  The warmth soothed her in a big way.  I asked my mom to pick up another one if she saw them.  Unable to find the original company, we ordered this.  I love the duck so much more!  The beaded fill is so much more cuddly and conforms to the side of her head / body for cool pack on a boo boo.  I wish my mom would have gotten her the duck 2 years ago instead!If you are planning to put it in the freezer, a quick tip from experience with the white tiger: put it in a zip top back and make sure that as much air is out of it as possible, otherwise your cuddly animal will get frost bite and not be nice to cuddle until it thaws out.Finally, and the last before I submit this review, I love that heating directions are ON THE DUCK!  There is a tag on it, like most stuffed animals, with the heating directions on it!  This may seem like nothing, but when you are busy with life and it has been 6 or 7 months since you heated it up, you will be grateful!  How do I know this after only having the duck a few days?  The white tiger that my mom bought 2 years ago doesn't have this. I have wung it heating it up, after finding the paperwork that was lost for a few years. I found that I have been heating the thing wrong for a long time, and I'm kinda lucky it hasn't exploded on me (it has a gel pack in it, not the beaded fill).  That won't happen with Mr. Ducky, because directions are attached right there on his tag.  :) [SEP]"",""[CLS] I actually saw this duck at the checkout counter at a store.  He was so cute that I couldn't pass him up and we have wayyy too many stuffed animals in this house!

The toy says for 3 years and up but I am considering buying one for my son, who is younger.  To be honest, I may steal the duck for myself to use from time to time.I microwaved the duck in 10 sec intervals and stopped at 50 seconds.  He was warm but not super hot.

I do however like that you can adjust the size of the pole to their growth and height. [SEP]"",""[CLS] So far my 9 months old has not knocked it over.  But if he hit just right, I can see it tipping.  The balls are sized right.  The height adjustments are great.  He loves the spinning rattles on the top and the other items on the backboard that he can manipulate and make noise.The bad, as others have said, is you have to pull down on the rim to make the cheering sound.  My son has no problem dropping the ball through the basket, and has to be encouraged to pull the rim.It's a pretty good toy overall, but not my favorite.  If he likes it, I'm cool with that. When my son is older, I will get him a Little Tikes adjustable basketball hoop. [SEP]",[CLS] Baby shoots...and scores! Get in the game with two stages of rewarding play.

I do recall that Target sold this beg. of last year for around $40-$50 and now it is sold here from private sellers for a huge amount. I'm grateful that I only paid $40 for it but a good lesson with Legos is that if you really like one of their products, then you must buy it before you can't find it sold anywhere.

I consider this set as value for money because there are three different house designs that can be constructed, and each design comes complete with detailed instructions.Since she is still quite young, we don't get very far each time we work on this model, but that's ok - it's a learning process, and it teaches her patience too.

It's durable and can zip around the sky pretty good.It's on the small side so it doesn't pull in the wind as much as bigger kites; so it's prefect for young kids, or young adults just starting to learn to fly. It's strong and can take some crashing from the first time pilot, as to be expected when learning.The Quantum by Prism would also be another great beginner kite, which is bigger and has more pull from the wind.You'll enjoy this kite! [SEP]","[CLS] Weve designed the Jazz to be simple to use, portable, and rugged enough to keep up with fliers on the go. Keep yours in the car, at the beach house, or strapped to your bike - you never know when you?ll get the urge to fly. Crafted with new pilots in mind, the Jazz can take a beating. A sturdy hybrid carbon/fiberglass frame and Vectran reinforced nose allow the Jazz to roll with the punches as beginners learn the ropes. Faster than our full-sized sport kites, but stable and easy to control in winds from 5 - 25 mph. Beautifully crafted by the kite experts at Prism Designs. With 25 years in flight, were committed to sharing the joy of kites with exquisitely designed, long-lasting products and all the info and support you need to have a blast in the wind.

If you install this and still notice some slop then make sure you put thin washers between the caster blocks and a arms area as well as by the caster block area too and that should do the trick. After doing this I noticed a huge difference in the front end stability of my rustler. It handles a lot better too, but it's still a rustler so the handling isn't exactly pin-point precise but for straight line speed runs this will make a night and day difference.

When Amazon finally put this item down to $4.99, I could not resist.  I am so glad that I took the leap and am really glad I got the price I got, but would have paid up to $14.99 for it.  Ours works perfectly well, as long as you are playing it correctly.  You do have to count and move the car the right number of spaces, over the little sensors, but if you do that (and games are about following instructions and directions right?) then it works perfectly.  It is really cute, although I wish the track and board were better looking.  I am really impressed with the concept, and love how they have tied traditional Monopoly up in a neat little bow for small children.  There are no loose ends or flaws in the rules, you know how spin-off games sometimes disappoint and do not translate well.  This one works so well.  The game takes just long enough to play to feel like you are accomplishing something, but no so long that the kids lose interest.  I think it transcends age groups well, my three year old played, my 14 year old was not bored to tears and I enjoyed playing with them.  The smaller ones will be able to play this alone for several years when they get just a bit older.  I would consider what your goal is for the use of the game when deciding whether to buy this item.  If you are thinking about purchasing this item to play with your kids (then grab it, it works fine) or whether you really expect your 2-5 year olds to play it independantly (then maybe wait) because you do need to be patient and purposeful in the moving of the car in order for it to work and register correctly.  I simply put my finger on the track where my son should stop and let him push the car and we had ZERO problems during our game.  Additionally, I think fresh batteries and a flat, hard surface are a factor in successful playing of this game.

The truck is cool looking, great chrome accents, with flames on the hood.  It rolls very well and lights up.  It's built fairly sturdy and should stand up to quite a bit of play as our other hess trucks have.  This one has less parts sticking out or moveable than the last two years, which were the biggest problems - we had some things pop off of those.My biggest peeve with this truck and previous years and the reason I give this toy only 3 stars is that the switch on the bottom is only able to be set to lights ON, OFF or Flashing - no young child is going to shut the lights off after using it, so the batteries wear out almost immediately, since I'm not going to run through infinite batteries for the sake of some lights, the lights are pretty useless.  This was the same with the previous hess vehicles - after the batteries ran out the first time, I didn't bother to replace. More ideally, the truck should have a button on top which the child presses to turn on the lights for a set amount of time, then have them automatically turn off.Also, for the price, the toy is missing at least one small sound effect in my opinion, a button which makes an engine noise would have been nice.

It has replaced the cement truck as my son's favorite tag along truck and we take in many places.  It is so durable and the scooping action works well.  Its a larger truck than most toys I'd expect a 2 year old to enjoy, therefore, I wish I would have found these trucks when he was one so he could grow into it.  I think 18 month olds would especially like it. I don't see him outgrowing it all that soon, especially since its great for playground play.  The price on this truck varies greatly day to day, so I am happy I bought it on a low day.  Its worth the money, however, and I would easily buy this for $2-.  The guy inside reminds me of a jumbo fisher price little person, and he's fun in other play sets, too.  Although this toy is totally plastic, its not that cheap feeling and I do think its durable.

B001063MI0,"[CLS] We've had this jungle gym (although the manufacturer calls it monkey bars) for a year and a half, and have three small children (5, 3, 1).  This has been a nice addition to our yard toys and I'm glad we got it.  Not my favorite item, but worth the money and we've gotten lots of use out of it.Things I like:  Not too big; the bars are just the right width for little hands to grasp well and I like that they are plastic (this didn't get too hot to play on in the summer); Very lightweight and easy to move around.One thing I don't like:  A couple of the rods have popped out and one we can't get back in.  It is thankfully in the side area (where the see-saw would go) so it's not crucial to holding up the jungle gym.This was easy conceptually to put together, but I couldn't do it by myself.  At the end, you really need two people, one of them being pretty strong!  And it does take awhile...an afternoon project.Also, I would buy this for young toddlers and let them grow with it.  My 5-year-old still like hanging around on it but it is mostly too small for him to get excited over anymore.  You would get more bang for the buck getting it for a very young child or early toddler.  My youngest was able to use this while she was just learning to stand...she could stand and hold on to a bar and feel like she was one of the big kids!  And then when she was learning how to walk she would just go around the whole thing, holding on to the bars.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] If your little one loves animals, the Fisher Price Little People A to Z Learning Zoo Playset should be on that child's wish list.  Colorful, sturdy, and a fun way to learn to identify animals and associated letters, this toy was a real hit with our eighteen month old grandson.  He is spending time each day playing with the figures, already placing them on the correct letter (matching the letter on the animal with that on the mat).Assembly is minimal; putting the batteries into the toy is the most taxing work involved in that operation.  The figures are all large enough so that our grandson was in no danger of choking on them if they were used as teething aids.  The colorful mat is not so big as to take up an extraordinary amount of floor space.  The sound buttons are not always centered on their letter, but are not so off-center as to frustrate a child who wants to activate one.  I did think the zookeeper was unnecessary - unless your little one likes to scoot cars along the floors as ours does.  However, our grandson had no interest in using the zookeeper with the Fisher Price Little People A to Z Learning Zoo Playset.  Additionally, the waterfalls and the pop-up gopher/prairie dog were of no interest to our grandson.  These two pieces could have easily been omitted without detracting from this toy's fun or educational value.  The carrying case is a nice touch; it allows one to keep all the animals together for storage so that there is less chance of losing one.  The edges on the plastic pieces are all smooth and well finished.Although this is recommended for 2 - 5 year olds, I believe that it is appropriate for younger children if an adult plays with the child when using this toy.  I suspect that children in the upper end of the recommended age range may become bored with this toy and not spend as much time playing with it as a younger child will.I would recommend watching for sales on the Fisher-Price site and for free shipping promotions.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] This game came under the tree at Christmas this past year.  My daughter (8 at the time) wasn't much impressed with it at first.  It doesn't look terribly fun to a kid that's not a fan of reading.  For that reason it got neglected for quite a while, even though my partner and I have played the adult version and loved it and she knew that.When we finally did bust out the game it was a hit.

We've had some pretty wild games where everyone was laughing.Here's a tip for playing with kids that aren't old enough to read yet.  This is what we do.  The kid who isn't old enough to read will pick a card at random and show it to an adult or the person next to them so someone knows what they picked (which isn't really important if only one kid can't read).

They also make for great judges because someone can always read for them and let them pick the winner.Something else we picked up somewhere, a friend of ours told us with the adult game that the description cards you've won at the end of the game are supposed to describe you.  We've had a lot of fun post-game by reminding everyone of the attributes they got in the game.

The game is fun to play and teaches us fractions. I can't get enough of it.There are many ways to play the game (7 to be exact). My favorites are games number 1 and 3. The way to play number 1 is you set all of the fraction pieces in the middle then players take turns taking pieces. When all the pieces are gone, the player who has the most complete pizzas built wins.The way to play game 3 is players take turns spinning the spinner and they follow the directions given on the spinner. For example, if it lands on 1/4, the player needs to try and find a pizza slice that is 1/4th of the pizza.One of the things that could be changed is the pizza is TOO realistic. It makes me hungry.

B001285L7Q,"[CLS] This is a fantastic action figure for any Indiana Jones fan!  It comes with numerous accessories.  The figure is partly articulated so you can pose it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We purchased a number of these figures for my son's birthday and he loved them.  You can buy them separately or with one of the Indiana Jones movies and it makes a tremendous gift that can provide a lot of play opportunities.Parents of little kids should check note that currently Amazon states that the Manufacturer lists these toys for ages 3-and-up. BUT NO! Take your toilet roll and check for yourself. The small items that come with Indy don't pass the choking test.  Small items include:  glasses, hats, whips, snakes, etc....~~Also note that if you buy 6 or more figures, you can collect the special stamps that are included and send off for a free 'special figure'. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Okay, so for starters, I'm a huge Indy fan. I have waited a long time for an Indiana Jones action figure line with decent quality and many characters, and since I've collected Star Wars figures forever, I actually wanted them to be this 3 3/4 size too (granted, I prefer my other collectible figures to be 6 inches or so, but I don't usually get accessories or playsets for those). Well, with the 4th Indy film, which is way underrated in my opinion (fellow longtime fans should give it a second viewing before deciding yea or nay; I had to warm up to it myself but love it now), that long dreamed of action figure line finally arrived from Hasbro... to mixed reactions. I'm sure many complaints were about the small size of the figures compared to the now more popular 6 inch or larger action figures out there for adult collectors these days. And, let's face it, most Indy fans are adults who grew up with the original films. However, I think what put most people off of this new line is that many, MANY figures were released to stores with awful paint jobs. I mean TERRIBLE paint jobs, specifically in terms of the eyes. This was most noticeable in the Raiders figures, and Indiana more than anyone.Now, in my case, I wanted to wait and make sure they made more figures, and I wanted to see if the price wouldn't go down a bit too. Figures are way overpriced these days. But, once I saw Last Crusade figures on the shelves (along with a price drop of a couple of bucks), I dived in. A few of those first figures I bought I have previously reviewed, and let me tell ya, those ones I selected had excellent face sculpts! Of course, with huge, cartoony eyes painted on some of the figures, it would sure be difficult to notice the sculpting underneath. So, combine those first bad impressions with the fact that young kids just don't seem to get Indy (yeah, it was the second biggest film this past year, but the toys sat on shelves till the figures hit 3 bucks recently, and they're still moving slowly with a few character exceptions), and you end up with the problem I'm having now. I have wanted a Short Round figure to stand next to my Indy figure forever (a desire carried over from my original Kenner Indy figure), and it seems those Temple figures are only going to be available online now, for those of us in the states, at outrageous scalper prices since the first couple of rounds of figures sold so poorly. And to add insult to injury, the Elsa and Colonel Vogel figures have been in extremely short supply since day one. Man, I want an Elsa!Anyways, as I searched fruitlessly for Elsa and the Temple figures this weekend at the big U.S. retailer who recently cut the price on these figures down to clearance levels, I did increase my total collection count to 14 (hope to add more before they're gone, too), and one of the main priority figures I did manage to find (though with a wee bit of difficulty) was the basic Raiders Indy figure. These were not hard to find at all before the figures went on clearance, and they even had playsets with very basic looking Indys out there. However, it was the holidays and money was tight. The other issue with this one is that big paint job issue. As I said, this is the one I saw most often with big ol' cartoon eyes, and poorly painted ones at that. However, if you check out enough of these figures, you're sure to find some that are actually painted correctly, and while the sculpt is nowhere near as good as the one for the Last Crusade and Crystal Skull Indy figures, it's more than passable considering all the detail that has gone into these figures. Seriously, these things are tight! From Indy's weathered leather jacket to his weapons and accessories, if you get one of these figures with a great paint job, you should be very pleased.They're well articulated too! I count approximately 18 points of articulation on this particular figure, and he comes with 5 accessories and a special mysterious artifact surprise (at this point, I forget which figures came with which mystery item, but suffice to say that each character comes with something different, and they're pretty cool relics but are sized for something larger, like maybe that new 6 inch or so Indy figure at Disney World). The accessories are Indy's trusty gun and whip, his MKVII gas mask bag, an action-posed alternate whip, and the golden idol he quested after in the opening scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Notable features with this Indy figure are a working gun holster and the fact that his hat is not removable. Most of them don't have removable hats, but I point it out here because some do. Frankly, these are better. The ones with removable hats look silly if you put the hat on, because their hats look too big on them. They look cool holding their hats though.To sum up, this figure is really pretty sweet with lots of cool attributes, IF you make sure to check out the paint jobs and pick one that you like. I've seen the big eyes problem with the Marion figure too, and probably others. A few figures, like Marion, don't really capture good likenesses, but even those are nice figures if you get ones with decent paint jobs, and some figures just look amazing (like the Grail Knight, Indy's dad, Young Indy, and the Crystal Skull and Last Crusade Indys). But, of course, this classic Raiders Indy figure is a MUST for your collection. [SEP]"",""[CLS] With the release of INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL, it's been nineteen years since the last Indiana Jones flick.  George Lucas, Paramount, and company weren't going to let this huge event movie get away without some major merchandising, including a full line of action figures.  I grew up watching the Indiana Jones films and I'm glad to own one of these action figures.  This figure is the classic Indy figure from RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  The figure harkens back to the classic action figures of the 1980s, but with more points of articulation.  The only negative about the figure is the face.  Even though this is a toy, the face is kind of creepy-looking when viewed straight on.  If you look at the face from the side, however, he looks like Indiana Jones.  Great item for any Indiana Jones fan, whether young or old. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a fantastic action figure for any Indiana Jones fan!  It comes with numerous accessories.  The figure is partly articulated so you can pose it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We purchased a number of these figures for my son's birthday and he loved them.  You can buy them separately or with one of the Indiana Jones movies and it makes a tremendous gift that can provide a lot of play opportunities.Parents of little kids should check note that currently Amazon states that the Manufacturer lists these toys for ages 3-and-up. BUT NO! Take your toilet roll and check for yourself. The small items that come with Indy don't pass the choking test.  Small items include:  glasses, hats, whips, snakes, etc....~~Also note that if you buy 6 or more figures, you can collect the special stamps that are included and send off for a free 'special figure'. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Okay, so for starters, I'm a huge Indy fan. I have waited a long time for an Indiana Jones action figure line with decent quality and many characters, and since I've collected Star Wars figures forever, I actually wanted them to be this 3 3/4 size too (granted, I prefer my other collectible figures to be 6 inches or so, but I don't usually get accessories or playsets for those). Well, with the 4th Indy film, which is way underrated in my opinion (fellow longtime fans should give it a second viewing before deciding yea or nay; I had to warm up to it myself but love it now), that long dreamed of action figure line finally arrived from Hasbro... to mixed reactions. I'm sure many complaints were about the small size of the figures compared to the now more popular 6 inch or larger action figures out there for adult collectors these days. And, let's face it, most Indy fans are adults who grew up with the original films. However, I think what put most people off of this new line is that many, MANY figures were released to stores with awful paint jobs. I mean TERRIBLE paint jobs, specifically in terms of the eyes. This was most noticeable in the Raiders figures, and Indiana more than anyone.Now, in my case, I wanted to wait and make sure they made more figures, and I wanted to see if the price wouldn't go down a bit too. Figures are way overpriced these days. But, once I saw Last Crusade figures on the shelves (along with a price drop of a couple of bucks), I dived in. A few of those first figures I bought I have previously reviewed, and let me tell ya, those ones I selected had excellent face sculpts! Of course, with huge, cartoony eyes painted on some of the figures, it would sure be difficult to notice the sculpting underneath. So, combine those first bad impressions with the fact that young kids just don't seem to get Indy (yeah, it was the second biggest film this past year, but the toys sat on shelves till the figures hit 3 bucks recently, and they're still moving slowly with a few character exceptions), and you end up with the problem I'm having now. I have wanted a Short Round figure to stand next to my Indy figure forever (a desire carried over from my original Kenner Indy figure), and it seems those Temple figures are only going to be available online now, for those of us in the states, at outrageous scalper prices since the first couple of rounds of figures sold so poorly. And to add insult to injury, the Elsa and Colonel Vogel figures have been in extremely short supply since day one. Man, I want an Elsa!Anyways, as I searched fruitlessly for Elsa and the Temple figures this weekend at the big U.S. retailer who recently cut the price on these figures down to clearance levels, I did increase my total collection count to 14 (hope to add more before they're gone, too), and one of the main priority figures I did manage to find (though with a wee bit of difficulty) was the basic Raiders Indy figure. These were not hard to find at all before the figures went on clearance, and they even had playsets with very basic looking Indys out there. However, it was the holidays and money was tight. The other issue with this one is that big paint job issue. As I said, this is the one I saw most often with big ol' cartoon eyes, and poorly painted ones at that. However, if you check out enough of these figures, you're sure to find some that are actually painted correctly, and while the sculpt is nowhere near as good as the one for the Last Crusade and Crystal Skull Indy figures, it's more than passable considering all the detail that has gone into these figures.

B0012BAZ4W,"[CLS] By coincidence I just dug one of these out of my basement, took it to work and assembled it at my desk over a lunchbreak. I'm not a verified purchaser because I got mine in the aftermath of the Great K.B. Toys Going Out Of Business Sale Stampede.K.B. Toys were around about 20 years ago, and were great value for money, but went bust in the 90s. I literally found this Spad kit in the trampled ruins of the store after their closing-down sale (New York shoppers can be animals) and I picked it up for one crisp dollar. I intended first to use it in conjunction with my 1920s RPG Call of Cthulhu, but it's a little too large. Then I was going to gift it on, and then I decided to put it on my desk.So, what you get in the box is two fuselage halves that assemble around the tailplane, rudder, nose c/w propeller, machine gun and cockpit. Upper and lower wings, the support pylons and undercarriage complete the airframe parts list. There are two pieces that assemble to make the base, nine small screws and three metal rods.The Instruction sheet was so small on mine I needed a magnifying glass to make sense of it, and even then I had to do some guessing. That said, the kit is quite obvious on how it all goes together. The tailplane is tricky to wrangle at first, and that damned machine gun keeps falling out at exactly the wrong moment but you can dry-fit the parts and get comfortable with how you'll proceed.You put the three rods into three sockets on the starboard fuselage side, assemble all the loose parts into that side, wrangle the left side into the tailplane and carefully squeeze the fuselage halves together. I'd recommend keeping hold of the rubber band that was used to hold the halves together in the box. Make sure the little rods are in the right places and are seated firmly in their sockets before you start assembling the halves. I used a leatherman as an anvil/puller but any hard surface would serve, with care. Also, the nosepiece has small keys that should fit into keyways in the fuselage halves.I'd also recommend some sort of flat blade you could use to gently pry apart the fuselage halves if they don't seat properly or you mis-fit some part or the machine gun falls out at the last minute. It might work to use tape to secure the blasted thing in place from inside, but I didn't have any to hand. That might also work to keep the cockpit insert in place.When assembling the wings I found it helpful to start the screws in the ends of the pylons before fitting them for real. Don't screw them down very far, a turn is good enough. It matters which way round the pylons sit in the lower wing, so pay attention as you fasten them down to the upper wing.Don't be too aggressive when torquing down these screws either. There should be no play in the parts, nor any proud screw-heads, but the scerws are not seating in metal and it is very easy to strip the threads. A stripped thread is going to be trouble. I have no idea how you might mitigate that. Possibly an epoxy putty like green stuff or milliput? I dunno.Fastening the lower wing to the upper is an exercise in creative swearing, as it must be done with the wings sandwiching the fuselage. I recommend a small collection of books be on hand as impromptu anvils and rests. Be careful here. It is easy to split the pylons as you tighten the screws.Then it is a matter of hooking the undercarriage into two holes, swinging it back and securing it and the lower wing with a single screw.The base is made by sliding the vertical part into the base, and that required some heft and inventive language. The Spad sits on the base by means of a peg/socket arrangement under the fuselage, so you can show the plan at rest or in flight.Downsides? No pilot is the biggy. The rudder is a bit loose and wobbles in its pivot. Apart from that and the hideous yellow color it is a nice display piece. It is NOT a scale model.I don't think that a child would have a very good time with this kit. There are simply too many places in which repeated concentration and do-overs are required, and those screws are a disappointment waiting to happen. Maybe a mid-teen could manage with no problems, but it's hard to generalize with children. Certainly not a younger kid as there are many small parts to be swallowed and a screwdriver to stab oneself with in inventive places. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I've put together about ten of these EZ Build models, and have been generally quite pleased with the results.  So I was disappointed with this one.  I had to ream out holes and do some force-fitting of parts.  The cabane struts (the ones that attach the upper wing to the fuselage)  appear to have been molded backwards.  As a result, I had to enlarge holes on the fuselage and even so the resulting force-fit gives some dihedral to the lower wing, contrary to both the real Sopwith and the displayed picture of the model.  For a child, attempting to assemble this model would be an exercise in frustration.Try the Spad instead.

If you like the look of Series 3 and 4, I wouldn't bother getting Series 1 or 2 because the design scheme is completely different.  If you're strictly looking for online prizes, Series 2 rocks!  You get multiple codes on most code cards good for anything from W-Shop Items to Trading Card Exclusive Room items.  I have bought a few of these boxes and in most, I've gotten almost a complete room theme per box.  You may end up wishing you had just one more chair and one less refrigerator.  Good Luck!

While he can count pretty high, he had been having trouble with knowing his numbers by sight, especially teens and twenties. Within the first ten minutes of play, he had quickly grasped these numbers as used he laser to shoot the appropriate numbers.We are pretty conservative in what we allow our children to watch, so my kids have no idea who the Star Wars characters really are and I was a little concerned about how Star Wars could be appropriate for young children. They do an excellent job in handling the violence issue so the game really isn't scary nor cruel. They have done an excellent job of making the learning of simple math facts fun. We are still on level one of game play, so I am not sure how the upper levels are or how advanced they get in keeping the attention of children. The first level was very appropriate for my 4 year old, who tends to work at a Kindergarten level. My 2 year olds are probably at least six months, if not a year or more from being ready for the first level of this game.I really enjoy the bonus questions used to help unlock doors - a great way of teaching and reinforcing the concepts of time and time of day. We hadn't intentionally tackled things like minutes versus hours with my four year old, but he was still able to get those type of questions right.

I added Snaptricity to our collection of mostly unexplored Snap-Circuits, and suddenly they're creating all kinds of basic circuits with switches, buttons, lights, motors, and electro-magnets.

For older children, they might be ready for the electronic components sooner, but with my younger kids, these electrical parts are great.We do not follow the instructions.

B0013TO94U,"[CLS] build and then? [SEP]"",""[CLS] Of course, when Luke first saw the Millennium Falcon, he exclaimed, What a piece of junk! I had the opposite reaction when I first saw this ship. It's absolutely gorgeous. The sculpt and paint job on the hull are nearly perfect. Unlike with the older versions, Hasbro doesn't require you to use decals for the hull, so it looks extremely realistic. More importantly, it's huge, measuring almost 3 feet long, which is over 30% larger than either the POTF2 or OTC versions. While it's not quite scale with the typical 3.75 figure, it's not too far off either. The Falcon comes loaded with lots of other features, from the light-up hyperdrive (looks great in the dark) to a boarding ramp that declines at the press of a button.I will just make a few recommendations and one area where this nearly perfect vehicle could be improved. First, it seems a lot of people have complained about the landing gear. I haven't had a problem so far. However, you do have to be a bit careful because the instructions aren't very clear about how to put them in. Certain pieces go into certain slots. If you do it correctly, the landing gear should stay in fine.Second, the interior of the ship does require decals. It's not too bad and for the most part they're easy to apply. However, if Hasbro were ever to redo this ship - not that they have to - I'd recommend getting rid of the decals altogether and just sculpting and painting the buttons and gear in the interior. Although I'm sure that'll be more difficult, it'd probably look fantastic.If you loved Star Wars, loved Han and Chewie, and the Millennium Falcon, this is probably going to be THE definitive version of the Falcon. if you get no other Star Wars toy in your life, make sure it's this one. You won't be sorry. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We got this for our son's birthday and I'm not sure who plays with it more - my 8 y.o. or my husband.  To be truthful, I find myself pressing buttons on it too.  This toy is a lot of fun to play with no matter what your age and it has remained a favorite for a couple of months now.For the parents FYI: (1) there is a page of stickers that take a while to figure out but not that difficult.  Just know that they are super sticky so there is little room for error. (2) The landing gear does NOT stay on so be prepared with Gorilla glue or just leave them off.This set is huge and is filled with bells and whistles.  There are buttons that provide weapon sounds, voiced passages from the first movie (I believe) and lights.  My sons love to turn the lights off and see the blue rear lights, head lights and cockpit flash.  There are compartments that hold an astonishing amount of action figures.  The medic area attachment has long been lost but everything else has remained intact.  There is even a small aircraft that fits neatly into a hidden port.  It also comes with it's owner Hans Solo and his sidekick Chewie.Unfortunately, I paid top dollar for this toy but I cannot complain since my boys (and husband) love it.  At the price listed ($140) it is a bargain when factoring in the hours of play and the utter delight when first opened. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I'm talking about the (really) BIG Corellian ships now. When the OTC Millenium Falcon came out in 2003 which was retooled from the original vintage Kenner mold I only dreamed of having a larger scale Falcon and Hasbro responded, though as impressive looking as the new larger scale Falcon is, it is only frustratingly as cool as it should have been.  Like Han's beloved ship, this bucket of bolts is always falling apart.The Pros:  IT'S MASSIVELY HUGE! Probably the biggest and best scaled Star Wars vehicle ever made and it's the next best thing to owning the bank-breaking Master Replicas Studio Scale prop replica costing thousands more.  The cockpit now accommodates up to 4 action figures and illuminates when one of 3 different buttons are pressed that make the hyperdrive, liftoff and flyby sounds while the hyperdrive glows a cool blue hue.  The interior playset areas have been expanded to include a medical bay to recreate Luke's rescue from Cloud City.  The landing ramp deploys with the touch of a button and slowly descends while making hydraulic sounds.  The holochess table illuminates when one of 3 buttons are pressed with over 20 sounds and phrases from A New Hope including lines like Let the Wookie win.The Cons:  The landing gear absolutely suck!  They do not stay on at all.  I tried every combination I could by carefully aligning the shapes with the groves and none of them would stay on and easily fall over.  As Luke would say, What a piece of junk! I am probably going to permanently glue them on though I am hesitant to ruin such a relatively expensive collectible.  Also, the plastic material is made out of that awful soft rubbery plastic that Hasbro has been using on everything it has been producing for the last few years for child safety reasons.  It feels horribly cheap for a $150 toy that should have used a hard durable plastic in the overall construction.  They sure don't make 'em like they used to.  I would still like to have seen the cockpit and the adjacent corridor connect via an opening hatch and there's still only 1 gunner station instead of 2 like in the film for both top and bottom gun turrets which fire two spring-loaded projectile missiles.  I'd rather the cannon barrels illuminated with strobbing lights and recoiled like in the film.  There's an escape pod vehicle that deploys which is completely made-up.  Supposedly the original designer of the Kenner Millenium Falcon wanted to include this feature in the vintage design.  Kids may like it but I don't particularly care for it at all.  It's already been done before on Padme's Naboo Royal Cruiser.  I'd rather they used this area for another omitted movie feature like the topside elevator lift Lando used to rescue Luke from Cloud City.Overall this hunk of junk is enormously impressive looking, but doesn't quite feel worth $150.  Perhaps around an even $100 would have felt about right on the mark so don't judge it by its size alone.  There were some missed opportunities to make this the truly definitive version of the Millenium Falcon. I'd try to pick this one up on sale, or if your lucky to win it in a chance card game of Sabaac.  This baby's still got a few surprises left in her sweetheart. [SEP]"",""[CLS] build and then?

If you do it correctly, the landing gear should stay in fine.Second, the interior of the ship does require decals. It's not too bad and for the most part they're easy to apply. However, if Hasbro were ever to redo this ship - not that they have to - I'd recommend getting rid of the decals altogether and just sculpting and painting the buttons and gear in the interior. Although I'm sure that'll be more difficult, it'd probably look fantastic.If you loved Star Wars, loved Han and Chewie, and the Millennium Falcon, this is probably going to be THE definitive version of the Falcon. if you get no other Star Wars toy in your life, make sure it's this one. You won't be sorry. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We got this for our son's birthday and I'm not sure who plays with it more - my 8 y.o. or my husband.  To be truthful, I find myself pressing buttons on it too.  This toy is a lot of fun to play with no matter what your age and it has remained a favorite for a couple of months now.For the parents FYI: (1) there is a page of stickers that take a while to figure out but not that difficult.  Just know that they are super sticky so there is little room for error. (2) The landing gear does NOT stay on so be prepared with Gorilla glue or just leave them off.This set is huge and is filled with bells and whistles.  There are buttons that provide weapon sounds, voiced passages from the first movie (I believe) and lights.  My sons love to turn the lights off and see the blue rear lights, head lights and cockpit flash.  There are compartments that hold an astonishing amount of action figures.  The medic area attachment has long been lost but everything else has remained intact.  There is even a small aircraft that fits neatly into a hidden port.  It also comes with it's owner Hans Solo and his sidekick Chewie.Unfortunately, I paid top dollar for this toy but I cannot complain since my boys (and husband) love it.  At the price listed ($140) it is a bargain when factoring in the hours of play and the utter delight when first opened. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I'm talking about the (really) BIG Corellian ships now. When the OTC Millenium Falcon came out in 2003 which was retooled from the original vintage Kenner mold I only dreamed of having a larger scale Falcon and Hasbro responded, though as impressive looking as the new larger scale Falcon is, it is only frustratingly as cool as it should have been.  Like Han's beloved ship, this bucket of bolts is always falling apart.The Pros:  IT'S MASSIVELY HUGE! Probably the biggest and best scaled Star Wars vehicle ever made and it's the next best thing to owning the bank-breaking Master Replicas Studio Scale prop replica costing thousands more.  The cockpit now accommodates up to 4 action figures and illuminates when one of 3 different buttons are pressed that make the hyperdrive, liftoff and flyby sounds while the hyperdrive glows a cool blue hue.  The interior playset areas have been expanded to include a medical bay to recreate Luke's rescue from Cloud City.  The landing ramp deploys with the touch of a button and slowly descends while making hydraulic sounds.  The holochess table illuminates when one of 3 buttons are pressed with over 20 sounds and phrases from A New Hope including lines like Let the Wookie win.The Cons:  The landing gear absolutely suck!  They do not stay on at all.  I tried every combination I could by carefully aligning the shapes with the groves and none of them would stay on and easily fall over.  As Luke would say, What a piece of junk! I am probably going to permanently glue them on though I am hesitant to ruin such a relatively expensive collectible.  Also, the plastic material is made out of that awful soft rubbery plastic that Hasbro has been using on everything it has been producing for the last few years for child safety reasons.  It feels horribly cheap for a $150 toy that should have used a hard durable plastic in the overall construction.  They sure don't make 'em like they used to.  I would still like to have seen the cockpit and the adjacent corridor connect via an opening hatch and there's still only 1 gunner station instead of 2 like in the film for both top and bottom gun turrets which fire two spring-loaded projectile missiles.  I'd rather the cannon barrels illuminated with strobbing lights and recoiled like in the film.  There's an escape pod vehicle that deploys which is completely made-up.  Supposedly the original designer of the Kenner Millenium Falcon wanted to include this feature in the vintage design.  Kids may like it but I don't particularly care for it at all.  It's already been done before on Padme's Naboo Royal Cruiser.  I'd rather they used this area for another omitted movie feature like the topside elevator lift Lando used to rescue Luke from Cloud City.Overall this hunk of junk is enormously impressive looking, but doesn't quite feel worth $150.  Perhaps around an even $100 would have felt about right on the mark so don't judge it by its size alone.  There were some missed opportunities to make this the truly definitive version of the Millenium Falcon. I'd try to pick this one up on sale, or if your lucky to win it in a chance card game of Sabaac.  This baby's still got a few surprises left in her sweetheart. [SEP]","[CLS] The new Millennium Flacon might well be the ultimate Star Wars toy. This famous spaceship can now seat 18 characters (including four in the cockpit, just like the movies), has a medical bay, auto-ramp, smuggling compartments, gunning station, Jedi training probe, Devarik table, and lots of lights and sounds.

B0015D2522,"[CLS] bought this for my grandsons birthday to build the cities for godzilla to knock down and it also works for angry birds [SEP]"",""[CLS] I purchased these for my 10-month-old son and me to play with, since I like building with blocks, and he likes knocking them over. I must say they're the perfect size for us; great for little hands (both mine and his!) to pick up, but none are small enough to be a choking hazard. They're beautiful, smooth, and the coloured ones have a lovely finish, so we're big fans.My one BIG issue, however, is with the selection of blocks. When we play with blocks, the larger rectangles (thick and thin)  are the ones we use the most (easiest for little ones to stack and balance), and yet there are VERY few of these compared to other blocks (four of the thin rectangles, two of the thick). On the other hand, there are TWELVE cylindrical columns, and twelve squared columns. Really? How are you supposed to use all of these? Especially for toddlers and children, the cylindrical columns are basically unitaskers-- you can't use them on their sides, you really can't stack them on top of one another; they're basically only good for supporting larger blocks, and even then you only need about a third that amount, max. How hard would it be to just include four of each kind of column, and make the others the flat rectangles?So overall there isn't a very good distribution of blocks, but the blocks themselves are good quality and lots of fun.UPDATE: Over a few months of play, the distribution of the blocks has become more and more of an issue. I'd be tempted to but another set, but then I'd have dozens of unused columns and still only 4 of the blocks we use the most. So FRUSTRATING! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Yes, these blocks are small.  I knew that when I purchased them, and so far my 18-month-old son doesn't seem to mind.  In fact, playing with these blocks has gotten him more interested in building.  We sat down and played with them for quite awhile after opening the package.  I plan to add to them over the next few years with Plan's larger set of unit blocks.  Until then, these are fine.The colors are not as vibrant as the picture shows, but I didn't buy them for the colors.  They are safe, non-toxic blocks that stimulate my son's imagination.  I love Plan Toys.  I have not been disappointed with a single one of their products, and we have about 5 of their toys now.  Very durable, no paint to chip off, and the packaging is simple, recyclable, and easy to open.I would recommend this set for younger toddlers, with the intent for buying larger sets when they are able to sit still longer and not knock down every structure as soon as you build it.Update 3-21-14These have been, to date, the most played-with of all the Christmas gifts my son received last Christmas.  He plays with them almost every single day.  A note on the size difference between these and standard unit blocks; we have both and I prefer these for his age (20 months) because they are smaller and less likely to cause damage or injury.  We recently purchased a set of Melissa & Doug standard unit blocks and they are heavy and huge!  As with these, 2 sets are better than 1, and I would have been better off to purchase another set of these for now and waited another year for those.  They are very heavy and my son can't lift the box, which upsets him.  He can also break something or hurt himself if he throws one of the larger blocks, whereas these don't hurt as much.  Both are great choices for open-ended play.  We love these! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I needed to put these blocks away for about six months after realizing that he was simply too young to play with them at one. It wasn't an issue with safety, I think part of it was the size. They are rather small [about three inches long at most] and little hands aren't very steady.But my son has gotten them back and now stacks them. He enjoys stacking them too, which is all I wanted out of these blocks.I ended up purchasing two sets of small blocks in total, one by this company and one by another. They're about the same size minus a millimeter or so on certain blocks.I think there's a good number of blocks for the price. The quality is also quite up to par. They're sanded down very nicely and the edges are rounded over nicely.My only con for the product is how small the blocks are. I wish they were bigger and I may be investing in a bigger set soon, possibly multiples in order for my son to have more fun with them.Also, be prepared to be finding these everywhere, losing many and picking them up often. I haven't had the misfortune of stepping on any of them yet, so I'm lucky there.

They're about the same size minus a millimeter or so on certain blocks.I think there's a good number of blocks for the price. The quality is also quite up to par. They're sanded down very nicely and the edges are rounded over nicely.My only con for the product is how small the blocks are. I wish they were bigger and I may be investing in a bigger set soon, possibly multiples in order for my son to have more fun with them.Also, be prepared to be finding these everywhere, losing many and picking them up often. I haven't had the misfortune of stepping on any of them yet, so I'm lucky there.

B0015EPR2Q,"[CLS] We bought the first ship as the Amazon frustration free option, and when it arrived the buttons for the music, etc, were broken. So we had to order a new one to be sure we had it for the holiday and return this one. Amazon did make it easy to return, I will give them that. We got the second one and after it was all put together saw that it is a cute toy. Not too much to it, not as big as we thought it would be, but cute. It is a little difficult to close up for a younger girl, and for me for that matter. But the pool feature is a huge bonus for my daughter. She opened this and love it right away. Of course, she needed water in the pool first thing. She loves the dolphin and has enjoyed playing with this as an addition to her other Barbie items. The disco light is cute, it makes some other sounds like dolphins talking, and it has a bed, lounge chair, food table (Barbie doesn't eat that healthy, I see! LOL) and it is fun. You have to be sure not to open the sides all the way or it will keep falling over, so this makes the play area a bit smaller than my daughter would like, but not a big deal. I think the full price is a bit much for this, but the sale prices make it worth buying. If your daughter is a Barbie fan, she will most likely enjoy this toy. When you can close it up, it is nicely tucked away somewhere and all the pieces do close in for easy storage. [SEP]"",""[CLS] First question:  I looked at the directions: where do these batteries go???  I opened the white plastic thing behind the disco ball but there's nothing there to hold batteries.  I tried to open the big white thing on top, but I can't open it without risk of breaking the toy.  I noticed in these reviews that many have been fortunate enough to enjoy disco music sounds & the disco ball lighting up.  I haven't told my granddaughters about this feature because I don't know how to make this happen.  Please give me advice on this.  Thank you kindly.  This would be appreciated & I'd love to surprise the girls with this added feature.  They already love this toy now.Now for my review:  This cruise ship is played with a lot in my playroom by my 4 & 5 year old granddaughters.  They love the long slide into the swimming pool (although it looks like a bathtub to them, they still like it & always request it to be filled with water - only fill it 1/2 way & be sure to have a couple bathtowels around in on the floor: when things & barbies go down the slide, it makes a big splash). They love the little extras like the luggage, the furniture, the catering/aquarium toy, the attached beds, etc.  They don't pay attention to the disco ball & dance floor but they would if they knew it was supposed to light up. So that's just treated like a decoration. They like to add barbie toys, swimming barbie, swimming kelly girl, barbie animals, anything plastic.  I taught them which barbies were allowed to get in the pool & which ones are never to get wet & they've followed those rules very carefully (they don't want to lose the privilege of playing with the other barbies!). It's about 4 ft. long when it's completely stretched out so it's easy for 2 girls to play with it at the same time.  If your little girl has a lot of imagination, she will play with this for a couple hours at a time.  None of us have ever been on a cruise ship but it doesn't seem to matter.  They just think of it as a vacation ship, which it is.  After playtime, the girls put all the barbie things in the large pool & close up the ship.  It stores away nicely on the floor, in the corner of the playroom.  I highly recommend it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] DAUGHTER WAS VERY EXCITED TO GET IT, BUT THEN ONCE WE STARTED PLAYING WITH IT NOT SO MUCH.

It's the most fun when there are two kids: they can run around taking pictures of each other going Say cheese!  It's fun to look at the pictures and send them to the grandparents.It almost goes without saying the picture quality is poor, however if you read the manual you can increase the quality pretty easily.  Copying pictures off the camera is easy: just plug a USB cable into the camera and your computer (no extra software needed).  Battery life has also proven to be good.

But the kids don't really seem to care about that either.Overall its been a great toy and every time we have other children at our house there seems to be a run for it. I haven't seen a preschooler yet who doesn't love it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Pros:1. Relatively inexpensive, especially at the price I paid, but not worth $60.2. Built tough for kids.3. Fun for the kids.4. Easy to use interface with only 4 control buttons plus a shutter button.5. Waterproof, but I haven't tested this.Cons:1. Terrible battery life.2. Terrible picture quality, even in bright light.3. Had to return the first one - kept shutting off even with fresh batteries.4. Not suppose to use rechargeable batteries.5. Very slow flash recharge time.6. Flash doesn't go very far (distance wise). Many times the picture is too dark (subject too far) or washed out (subject too close).7. Small and low quality LCD display for previewing photos - makes it hard to see.Other:1. Includes about 64MB of storage which can hold over 500 photos since they're only about 90 to 130K each.2. Resolution is 640x480.3. Some reports and news stories of viruses on these, but mine didn't have one.4. The shutter button can be difficult for kids to press at first, but my 2 year old eventually got it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This turned out to be one of the best toy purchases I've made.  My two year old son doesn't have a lot of interest in toys; instead he prefers the real (and often breakable) thing.  Here we have the best of both worlds: a working digital camera that's stood up to the best my son can do.  It's the most fun when there are two kids: they can run around taking pictures of each other going Say cheese!  It's fun to look at the pictures and send them to the grandparents.It almost goes without saying the picture quality is poor, however if you read the manual you can increase the quality pretty easily.  Copying pictures off the camera is easy: just plug a USB cable into the camera and your computer (no extra software needed).  Battery life has also proven to be good.  I've had it about four months and only changed batteries once.The only minor complaint I have: the button to take pictures is on the front which is a little awkward for small hands.

B00160D4GA,"[CLS] I got this for my nephew who is only 5 and a little young for it according to the recommended age. However, he has quite a bit of other legos and is pretty bright, so I figured if I helped him build it he would enjoy it. And enjoy it he did! It took us about an hour to build it, and despite his age, he was generally able to follow the instructions well enough to understand how to help me gather the right pieces. I grew up with lego starting way back in the 80s with the first early 'space' legos, and I've got to say they've improved the instruction books a fair amount. It was logical and straight forward.The end result was the sort of toy that I wish they'd made back when I was a kid! Legos back then were a lot more basic and a lot less awesome! This set made me salivate, and I enjoyed the heck out of helping my nephew build it. He loves it, but took it apart a week later and built something else entirely (the best thing about lego!). That's when having a large (422) number of pieces is great.Highly recommended for any kid that likes legos. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My son thinks the Jetrax T6 is very cool looking, but (as noted above) he does not enjoy it as much as his Axalara T6.Here are the reasons why according to my son:1. The mechanism that is supposed to control the movement of the wings is very hard to work and does not put the wings all the way down.2. The parts come off more easily during play.3. It tips backward when stationary.4. The handle for holding it during play is a little small.He plans to turn this piece into a biocycle with his Lego club code.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] This Jetrax set was one of 5 Bionicle sets my 7 year-old got for Christmas. It was on the top of his list, and for good reason. The vehicle itself is very cool... about a foot long with lots of weapons and moving parts. It is recommended for ages 9-16, and was really a challenge for my experienced 7 year-old builder. Took him about 3 hours with occasional help from Mom & Dad.We loved the new style shooters on this vehicle. There are three of them, each holding 4 balls. Firing is both consistent and accurate, which I can't really say about many past Bionicles weapons. They are a little bit tricky to load, but my son got the hang of it after a while.I'd say the only negative about this set is that the figure that comes with it is pretty lame. It is a washed-out, simplified version of Antroz that's not nearly as impressive as the version sold separately. Overall, though, a great set both in terms of building fun and playability.

The premise is simple, but it allows kids to create fairly complex sculptures in a non-toxic and mess-free way. Using PixOs, children create designs by placing the beads on a grid-like tray. To place PixOs, kids can use either the provided pen, or use their fingers. Once the PixOs have been placed, the child sprays them with water using the included spray bottle and allows them to dry. Once dry, the PixOs sculptures can be removed from the tray and placed anywhere.<P> The Ultimate Design Station requires some assembly, which a parent should be able to quickly do. Once assembled, the station provides many tools that make playing with PixOs even easier. It includes a PixOs sorter and dispenser, which is helpful since the tiny beads are often easy to lose track of. It also features a bendable hose fan, which can help speed up the drying process. This hose fan can also function as a clamp, allowing kids to hold their creations in place and work on them piece-by-piece. [SEP]",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81hGVje-1ML.jpg

The result will determine how the round is played.Likewise is the most common result. The player turns over the two cards, with the adjective describing the noun.

Together they come up with an answer, and all players try and match.The first player to eight points wins.What I like about the game:*The two different decks make this a highly replayable game. One game it may be Unusual Comedian and Weird Magazine. There's plenty of cards on top of that.*The game itself is fun, and coming up with what you think everyone else is going to say--just to have everyone else say something completely different--can be quite enjoyable.What I don't like about the game:*The Wise Guys option just seems...weird. It doesn't really work all that well. It's not a disaster, but it seems like something different would work better.*This is minor, but the production is very childish. The dry-erase boards all have goofy faces on them. No one cares, really, and it's a party game, but if you have adults over who are still sober they may look at you funny when you pull out something that looks like a preschool toy set.We had a blast playing it, but like many party games the fun was coming up with inside jokes and creative answers. Those answers are the most fun, but they're also the ones that will make you lose. In games like Things and Say Anything, players are rewarded for coming up with different solutions; in this game, you're rewarded for thinking like other people. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but the most fun we had with this game had little to do with the goal of the game.

It is too advanced for my son to set up by himself, so the suggested age range of 6-12 is probably accurate.  With some major help from dad, however, my son likes this toy.  The instructions are poor, offering picture-only guidance with no written directions.  Sometimes the setup illustrations just aren't clear, but once you figure out the basics of how the different pieces fit together it isn't too hard to set things up-just expect a little bit of a learning curve rather than instant construction.

The finished tracks are pretty secure, but a stray elbow or careless bump can knock pieces loose so some care should be taken to avoid rebuilding.This kit features a combination speaker/control box that turns the magnetic launching tower on and off and gives the user control over sound effects.  There are two sensors that can be placed on the track where desired which trigger flashing lights and sound effects.  There are several background rhythm and music loops that can be played to accompany the balls doing their thing on the track.

Everything goes together with a hex screw -- hex screwdrivers included.The poles are lightweight and designed to work exactly as illustrated on the web page.My 5 year old daughter was first.  I had the foot rests on the lowest setting and the handlebars on the highest setting.  At 44 inches, she was far too short for the bend in the pole to go under her armpits as shown.  I raised the footrests as high as they would go hoping that would make her tall enough to get them under her armpits.  Still no go.  It was not possible for her to use it as intended, so she gave up.My 8 year old son, 55 inches, did fit on the stilts.  I placed the footrests back on the lowest setting and his armpits barely made it over the bend.  If I placed the footrest one notch up, he would fit, but he felt so insecure, he did not want to continue trying.What a shame.  Neither of my kids are using this now.

[SEP]","[CLS] Raising playtime to new heights! Stilts have been a favorite of children and adults for decades, but the basic stilt design has remained the same... until now! Air Kicks Walkaroo JR Stilts are easier to learn, easier to use, more ergonomically correct, and more FUN! Most stilts are simply straight poles with foot platforms attached to the sides. The tops of the poles rest behind the shoulders, forcing the upper body to slump forward. Not these! Walkaroos have an S-bend which wraps comfortably around the shoulders, allowing you to remain upright for easier walking. Very similar to the Original Walkaroo Stilts, this sturdy aluminum model is lighter in weight, adjusts to three different heights, and costs less. Their light weight makes them easier to carry and quick to maneuver, even for younger children. Perfect for anyone under 110 lbs. (teens or kids, from age 5 and up), the ergonomically correct design of Walkaroo allows a stilt-ist to walk in a more natural, upright position that encourages active play (and teaches balance). As kids gain balancing skills, they can move the footrests higher for more challenge. Walkaroo JR feature non-marking, no-slip rubber feet and footrests, and comfortable foam cushioning on the handles and shoulder rests.<br><br> Maximum rider weight is 110 lbs. Geospace model #11112.

And I really mean add. Whenever a card is played, it's numerical value is added to the total. The only rule is that the total can't exceed 99.There are certain cards that have special functions, which, of course, is what keeps the game interesting. Aces count as a 1 or as 11. Fours reverse the direction of play without adding anything to the total. Nines also don't anything. Tens increase or decrease the total value of the pile by ten. And kings reset the value of the deck to 99.In Ninety Nine or Bust there are still 52 cards. And the object is still not to exceed 99. The cards are numbered from 1-10. There are no 9s. There are only four special cards: subtract 10, stays the same, reverse direction, and 99. Because their functions are actually written on the cards, the game is much easier to learn. There's also a little less to think about, fewer choices to make. And the special cards don't look at all like normal playing cards, so the game itself seems special, which it is.There's a wonderful balance between chance and the illusion of choice. There aren't any winning strategies. But it feels like there are. You get to make other people lose. But again, only if you're lucky and they're not.

Each player is trying to stay in the game for as long as they can by using their cards to not go over 99.Most cards have a number on them - which you add to the running total. However, there are 4 types of Action Cards. One is a 99 card (which gets you to 99 right away). There is another card that is a subtract 10 card so if your are on 99 it will subtract 10 from 99.There are two other Action Cards - one has players reverse direction and another has the running total stay the same amount. If a player cannot make a move without going over 99, they lose the round and need to put a chip in the middle. Each player has 3 chips and when they run out, the player may no longer play in the game.

B0017IZY1E,"[CLS] What would you call a word search game that is not just a puzzle, but a deeply engaging, and often laugh-provoking contest for 2-4 players? How about if it were not played with paper and pencil at all, but on a board - a very cleverly designed board that reveals the words you are searching for one at a time, and the first person who can find that word must be the first to squeeze a very silly noise maker, and only then can use her own contact-lens-like plastic chips to cover each letter in that word, every letter being connected in a straight line exactly as you would expect in a word search puzzle? And, to top it all off, what if, when the line in which that word was found crosses a word that another player had already created, that player's chips were removed from the board, and, should that result in another word that is already claimed to suddenly become incomplete, those chips as well were to be removed? So that you can never really tell who is winning, even though you might be 40 chips ahead of everyone else, until the very end of the game?You'd call it two things. You'd call it Wordquest, because that's the name of the game. And the other thing you'd call it would be Major FUN, because it's exactly the kind of game the Major FUN award was designed for.Like almost every game published by Goliath, every aspect of the game is designed for ease of use and long-lasting fun. Each of the 20, differently-themed word search puzzles is printed on a large, laminated disc. The disc is mounted on a round base. A transparent grid provides concave receptacles for the transparent, concave, playing chips. Because the chips and the receptacles are both concave, it is extremely easy to use a finger tip to place and remove them during play. A mounting ring fits on top of the grid and covers all the target words. Rotating the ring reveals each word to be found. Zip-lock baggies are provided for the chips, and four pits surround the playing area so that the chips are easily accessible during play. At the end of the game, everything fits back in the box with ease.Being able to remove words that the opponents have already scored is probably one of the most compelling of all the clever mechanics that have gone into making Wordquest as fun as it is. Though there is no strategy involved in playing the game, when you successfully cross words with another player you get the same sense of smug superiority as you would if your victory were actually justified.And then there's that squeaky, exclamation-mark-like thing that you use to announce that you've been the first to find a word. It makes such a perfectly silly sound that it's almost hard to take it seriously, even if you're the one who didn't find the word.Younger children who are old enough to successfully solve word search puzzles might have difficulty with the small chips and the competitive aspect of the game. We'd recommend it to families with kids who are old enough to appreciate both. And, of course, to anyone who likes the visual and conceptual challenge of word search puzzles.

You get settlements and cities instead of houses and hotels.STAR WARS GAME PLAYThere is also the option of playing with Star Wars rules in the rule book, pitting the light versus dark side.All of it relies on the roll of the dice. Players move around the board as usual, but if they roll a 6 on one die, they have an option of using a move determined by the number on the other die.For example, for the Light Side, 1 is EARLY DISCOVERY, the player rolls again and if it is 2 or higher, s/he can get 1 available property or collect $[...] from the bank. If the next roll is a 1, the player pays $[...] to the bankThe Dark Side a 1 is on the other die means do an AMBUSH, whereby if the next roll is a 4 or higher, they may steal 1 property. If they roll a 3 or less, they must pay $[...] to the bank.It is all very complicated and requires the use of the rule book. I personally would rather not play something that requires me to stare at the rule book constantly.TOKENSYou get six collectible tokens: Ahsoka Tano, Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Captain Rex, Asajj Ventress and General Grievous. They feel solid, made of metal and are about 2 inches tall. Personally, I `d prefer if they made them smaller, like classic Monopoly.Also, it would have been better if they used a ship, blaster, driod, etc. to match the classic style.

When my son-in-law plays this game with new friends, he always tells them when I had the choice between ketchup (a card someone else gave me) and a dozen red roses (the card he gave me) and I rated ketchup higher.  (I'll never live that one down.)  If you like having fun, you'll love this game! [SEP]"",""[CLS] We have had this game for about four years.  We started playing it when our youngest was barely reading.  Even now, when the oldest is in high school, we still play it and still have a lot of fun!The premise of the game is that everyone picks out two cards in their hand that they think is a favorite of the picker.  These things can be concrete or abstract: the beach, brownies, a romantic comedy, sleeping, world peace, camping, roller coasters, silence, s'mores, celebrities.  There are things that one might assume would appeal more to girls than boys (a bouquet, perfume, lotion, a soft blanket) and some more to boys (football, wrestling, weight-lifting etc).  I say assume, because the results of the game are anything but predictable.  That's the fun of it.The picker ranks the cards in order of preference and they are given points from 1-6.  There are little wavy plastic, brightly colored coins.At the end of six rounds, points are tallied.In my opinion, Whoonu is one of the freshest games from Cranium.  There's no clay building, no acting, no competition really.  Instead, personalities are gently revealed and assumptions debunked.  Think only girls like romance?  Only boys like football?  Wrong, and wrong.  Think adults don't like roller coasters?  Or kids liking a moment of quiet?  You'll be surprised at the things you find out about friends and strangers.  It is a ton of laughs, and a good time.  I only wish that there were more plastic coins, they're really cute. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We played this game at my son's house on Father's Day. We had pretty many people playing.  It was really a lot of fun.  It helps people get to know more about each other in a fun way. Players get cards and choose which one they think will be each person's favorite thing. The person whose turn it is looks thru the cards that were picked for him and puts them in order of how he likes them. The player who had the first choice gets the highest coin, etc. I liked it so much that I ordered this game from Amazon. I could not find it at any store or online store.

When my son-in-law plays this game with new friends, he always tells them when I had the choice between ketchup (a card someone else gave me) and a dozen red roses (the card he gave me) and I rated ketchup higher.  (I'll never live that one down.)  If you like having fun, you'll love this game! [SEP]"",""[CLS] We have had this game for about four years.  We started playing it when our youngest was barely reading.  Even now, when the oldest is in high school, we still play it and still have a lot of fun!The premise of the game is that everyone picks out two cards in their hand that they think is a favorite of the picker.  These things can be concrete or abstract: the beach, brownies, a romantic comedy, sleeping, world peace, camping, roller coasters, silence, s'mores, celebrities.  There are things that one might assume would appeal more to girls than boys (a bouquet, perfume, lotion, a soft blanket) and some more to boys (football, wrestling, weight-lifting etc).  I say assume, because the results of the game are anything but predictable.  That's the fun of it.The picker ranks the cards in order of preference and they are given points from 1-6.  There are little wavy plastic, brightly colored coins.At the end of six rounds, points are tallied.In my opinion, Whoonu is one of the freshest games from Cranium.  There's no clay building, no acting, no competition really.  Instead, personalities are gently revealed and assumptions debunked.  Think only girls like romance?  Only boys like football?  Wrong, and wrong.  Think adults don't like roller coasters?  Or kids liking a moment of quiet?  You'll be surprised at the things you find out about friends and strangers.  It is a ton of laughs, and a good time.  I only wish that there were more plastic coins, they're really cute. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We played this game at my son's house on Father's Day. We had pretty many people playing.  It was really a lot of fun.  It helps people get to know more about each other in a fun way. Players get cards and choose which one they think will be each person's favorite thing. The person whose turn it is looks thru the cards that were picked for him and puts them in order of how he likes them. The player who had the first choice gets the highest coin, etc. I liked it so much that I ordered this game from Amazon. I could not find it at any store or online store. Delivery was faster than expected.  The game is in a nice tin to help it last for years. I would recommend this game to any family that wants to spend some time together.

He ripped pretty early on but it was only cosmetic but eventually after a couple years of play his hip broke and now he doesn't walk really only leans to the sides. Mattel/Fisher Price has the most amazing customer service though, since he was discontinued they couldn't give me a replacement but they sent me a voucher instead after already getting a couple years worth of play I was very satisfied with their help. Honestly even with his flaws though he's still one of my sons favorite dinosaurs (and we own over 100) he carries him around and puts the bone in his mouth. My rating is for my sons review.

I also thought grandchildren might like it,  THEY HAVE.  my 2 yr old grandaughter was afraid at first but with some discussion she started playing.  She really liked it. named him Rexy.  he follows her everywhere.  works better on my hardwood floor but does go on low profile carpet too. As adults we have had fun too.  family spent a night watching and following him around.  Lots of laughs and comments.

It's bad enough your spending a lot of money on the toy but if you have to keep replacing the batteries it will add up and cost more than the toy. They need to put rechargeable batteries in these toys, like spike the ultra dinosaur. I gave D Rex four stars just for the look of it, cause it looks pretty real. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The dinosaur is smaller than I expected for the price.  This sits about 20 inches tall and about 3 feet in length.  This product uses 3 AAA batteries in the remote and 5 C batteries (which are not supplied).  Get batteries with the toy or your child will be disappointed.  You will need a Phillips screwdriver to undo the screws for the battery covers on the dinosaur and bone remote.The 5 button remote has various modes: Guard, attack, seek, Yes and No Question and Answer and Prank buttons.  It is shaped like a bone.  It is solid and fits neatly into your pet's mouth.The dinosaur is covered with a green rubber exterior with articulating extremities, tail, eyes and mouth.  There are sensors on the head that sense petting and sensors in the mouth that detect what is in front.The operation is simple for a child to work.  The seek function is decent but it frequently sensed me (at a 90 degree angle) rather than my daughter (directly me in front).  Prank button is entertaining with the 'burp' by the dinosaur.  The yes/no function is random but funny.  Guard function works pretty well, with the sensors activating the pet.  Attack mode allows forward mobility and smoothly.  The action and sound effects are realistic - except when you pet the dinosaur and he/she starts panting like a dog (I don't think a T-Rex pants like a dog - do you?).  He will even chomp on whatever you place into his mouth.Overall, the pet is amazing and its action is lifelife (based upon our imagination).If you are looking for a virtual pet, this toy is worth a look.

B001820194,"[CLS] This is my second experience with the tricorder from Diamond Select. My first approach was the Medical tricorder+white handle phaser, which was broken and didn't even work; so I did risk a bit and tried again this toy, but this time I did get the standard sciene scanner model.Quality wise, it is cheap, but feel a bit more solid than the medical model; the doors and hinges are decently hard to open and close, so it won't flap around while carrying it around. It has the moire effect piece in the center area, which works when the button on the main console is pressed. Make a lots of noise but it is OK.The bottom part is used to hold the battery pack and a hand scanner; which is basically a LED mounted on a plastic support; you turn it on, and it cycle through colors. No sounds; since to have the sound effect you have to turn on the moire effect part, which simulate the scanning. I would prefer a button on the device that would activate the sound, like the medical tricorder, but it is OK.The top part flips open and this is where you find the main monitor and the 3 buttons to operate the device. The first when pushed, will turn on a LED sequence, and when you close the lid, will start 2 different effect sequences: one is like a call effect, so when you open the lid, it will say something about survivors or resources around you; the second will make a sparkly noise, and when you open the lid, will play an action sequence.The second button turn on and off the moire effect and the scanning sound; until you push it again, while the LED flash alternating colors. The third button play sentences from Mr Spock, each press is one sentence, keep it pressed and play all the sentences in sequence.Overall it is a fun item; too bad that the quality is not super high, and the price reflect that; also the screen is basically a sticker, and there is not much going on with this device, beside the 3 buttons on the upper part, but still it replicate almost perfectly the low-fi flavor of the original props from the show.

B0019O198I,"[CLS] The component quality is good and the concept is good.  Very, very short game, though (a maximum of 8 moves each).  At this point each game ends with a whoops!  Also, it seems like the first few moves don't have any strategy at all so they go really fast.  Probably it will take more skill to get to the point where I can play with strategy and force a win or be forced to lose.Fun way to spend a couple of minutes (not more).

[SEP]"",""[CLS] This game has rather simple rules but is most definitely not a simple game. Rather, the idea is simple to learn. However, trying to eliminate possible similarities becomes tough. While the gist of the game requires that you get 4 in a row within a straight line, actually, there are many ways to increase the challenge in this game. By increasing the challenges, you and your opponent make it more difficult to have the easy wins which becomes thrilling. However, everything depends on planning. You can help to reduce the chances of defeat and hinder your opponent from winning when planned well!!! This game is definitely worth buying!!!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Get this game and you won't be sorry. It is a 2 player game that has you on the edge of your seat till the end. every move is calculated I can't pass a weekend without playing this game with my 10 yr old. I highly recommend it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Quarto is a 3 (maybe 3.5) star game.One great aspect of Quarto is that no player is ever behind, no player has to play catch-up to pull back to even, to a 50% chance of winning. Instead, suddenly one of the two players makes four-of-a-kind-in-a-row and the game ends.There are soooo many variables in the game that planning or calculating ahead is usually implausible or unmeaningful. The first several moves of the game do not really matter, because all things remain possible. Thus the game is usually not absorbing. Most games of Quarto do feature a golden 2-6 turn phase where the strategies finally become plausible and fun; then the game suddenly ends.Games last 6-15 minutes, just right. You usually play best of three games is winner.Quarto is nicely interactive because you must play the one piece that your opponent handed to you and the end of his latest turn.Each piece has encodes values of four dimensions: color, shape, height, density. Each dimension has only two possible values. Thus a brown short cylinder that is hollow (low density) is entirely different from a white tall rectangle (3D of course) that is solid (not hollow; high density).Getting four cylinders in a row is one way to win. Pretty much an old idea already seen in earlier games.I am glad I have Quarto and I will play it again. I like Quarto, but I do not love it.Better games include Quoridor, Khet, Kamisado, and Twixt. Of these five abstract strategy games, Quoridor and Quarto are the most likely to be enjoyed by your wife. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Quarto will remind you of Tic Tac Toe, until you actually play it. Like Tic Tac Toe, you're trying to get all your pieces in a row. And that's about it, Tic Tac Toe-wise.There are 16 pieces. Eight blond pieces and eight dark pieces. But if you look a little closer, you'll notice that each piece is different. Nobody's a color. Each has an attribute (size, color, shape, hollowness) that it shares with three other pieces. So your tall square blond solid piece is like the tall round dark piece that has a hole in it, because they are tall.Your object is to add the piece that completes a row, column or diagonal of 4 pieces, all of which have the same attribute. Not necessarily all blond pieces or all short pieces, and certainly not all your pieces. Maybe all round pieces or all solid pieces. Or all pieces with a hole.So things are not, as they say, merely black or white. To win, you have to continually change what attribute your looking for. Much more like life, strategically-speaking.And then there's one more intriguingly life-like rule you should know about: You decide what piece your opponent will play next. Really. That's what you do. When your turn is over, you hand the piece of your choice to your opponent. And now that we're speaking about strategy, suddenly everything becomes much more subtle, even more interesting. Because you're trying everso hard to give your opponent the very piece she really wouldn't want. A piece, in fact, that might very well be the one piece that will make you win.It's a unique concept in the world of strategy games - and uniquely welcome. Because you have to think even more closely about what your opponent might be thinking.The designer, Blaise Mller, suggests a variation for those who need yet more strategic depth. How about counting 4-in-a-square as well as 4-in-a-row? Ah, how subtle. How challenging. Which makes you wonder about 4-in-an-L, or 4-in-a-zig-zag, even.In other words, Quarto, like the majority of games in the Gigamic line, has just about all the elements that make a game Major FUN. It takes maybe 5 minutes to learn and maybe 5 minutes to play, and yet it's deep enough to be worth playing over and over. It's as easy to learn as it is because it's based on something familiar. It's as intriguing as it is, because it offers something unique. It's elemental enough to be easily modified to increase or decrease the challenge. It's made of wood. It's durable. It even has a drawstring bag to house the pieces. And, for a modest mailing fee, Fundex will replace any lost piece. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This game is very easy to learn.  Each of the 16 playing pieces has 4 attributes, height (tall & short), color (white and brown), shape (circle & square), and hollow/solid.The goal is to get 4 of the same attributes in a row (for example, you could have 1 tall white circle, 1 short white circle, 1 tall brown circle, and 1 short brown circle in a row, and that would be a winning set because they are all circles, even though they vary with respect to the other attributes).The catch is that your opponent picks the piece you have to place on the game board.This game is similar to SET, in that you are trying to make winning patterns across several attributes.  It is different because you are also trying to block your opponent from making winning patterns.I do wish this game were less expensive so that more people can enjoy it.  Not everyone can drop $30 for a game.  It is a beautifully made wooden game, but it would be just as much fun if it were made of something inexpensive and priced under $10.Nevertheless it is a game worth owning. And, for trivia buffs, this game was futuristic enough to appear in an episode of Star Trek Voyager :) [SEP]","[CLS] Quarto! Has a 44 board and 16 pieces.

Then a list of colored pieces are given that must fit in the available space. You can start out with just a few rows open which limits the difficulty. As you move up to using the entire board, it becomes more and more difficult to find the right placement for all pieces.There are also picture shapes to create (not using the board) but using specific colored pieces - like Tangrams with blocks.It is a great way to spend some quiet time stimulating brain cells.

They are all basically the same and usually there are 12 different pieces,each made of 5 cubes. That is all the different ways in which 5 cubes can be positioned in flat arrangements. I have several versions,but I recently got one much the same as this. It is approximately 12 X 6,and made of high quality wood and very well finished. There is no manufacturer's name on it or the package. There is one difference in that there there are 11 5-cube pieces,plus 3, 1-cube and 1,2-cube pieces. The tray has slots numbered from 3 to 12 where a bar can be placed .This allows for 10 sized spaces to fill with pentominoes. In other words,you get 10 puzzles for the price of one. One can also use the pieces to construct 3-D shapes without using the tray. Mine is also of high quality but came without any booklet of puzzles. It was made in China and what you would call a knockoff.The store also sold a very nice Tangram set,also without any booklet of puzzles ,made in China,no manufacturer's name , again a knockoff. In any case,there is no cover for the tray,so I used heavy clear plastic and elastic bands ,to make a cover for transporting or storing,when the package becomes useless.

B0019SEI1E,"[CLS] The other reviews about this being just okay are pretty accurate. However, an additional issue to consider is that there are 3 objects per slide, equally spaced across the slide. Depending on how far your slide frame/adjuster goes from side to side, you may end up having to not use it and instead put the slides in vertically (vs. the more standard horizontally on the base) in order to center the viewing circle under the viewing scope area. While this works okay, it doesn't allow find movement of the slide using the controls, nor does it secure the slide to prevent it moving out of place if having multiple viewers look at the object being studied.So overall, kind of boring things to look at and due to spacing of 3 objects per slide, your slide frame may not adjust far enough side to side to view the outer objects w/o modifying your slide placement.

B001C81DO6,"[CLS] Has been a big hit with our 4 year olds. Considered getting something bigger - which I'm sure they would have enjoyed - but not sure I wanted something bigger in our yard. This came in a very destroyed box - its super heavy - but all pieces were there and it was relatively simple to put together as long as you followed the instructions. Definitely needed more than one person to do it. It took my father and I about 3 1/2 hours to put it together. You need someone to help hold the pieces as you assemble them, and again when you tighten all the bolts. The directions could have been a little more detailed when it comes to suggested tools - but we were able to use the alan wrench included an our own tools to make it work fine. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Love it!  My daycare kids love this climber.  Best for ages 3 and up.  My 2 year olds do climb but struggle a little.  The bars are kind of far apart so they have to work to climb but can accomplish reaching the top.  The adept climbers have no problems.  The 4 year olds can stand on the ground and almost reach the very very top if they are a little taller.  Perfect because if/when they do fall it is not that far to land.  Easily moved to clean under as I have mine on grass.  I have sat and climbed on it no problem and my 19 year old daughter (small person) climbs to the top with the kids!  Sturdy and safe will not tip even with 4 or 5 kids on the same side.  If concerned you could anchor easily. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Growing up we LOVED the monkey bars at the park. That was our favorite thing to do.

Overall we are excited and my daughter looovvveeessss it!!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] UPDATE: i just wanted to add that after 2 years, this thing looks just like it did when we bought it. sturdy and not a speck of rust of wear and tear. i am very impressed. also, our kids, now 6.5, 4, and 1 play on it almost every single day. it still gets tons of use from the neighbor kids, too, even the 7-9 year olds like it (if not for climbing, for just playing house/cave/tepee whatever their imagination brings them to). i highly recommend!! i am trying to figure out if i buy another, if there is a way to connect those bars across the bottom to make it taller.... :)This was a very generous birthday gift for my 2 year old son from my parents.  He is such a little monkey and climbs all over everything, most of the time that means it is stuff he should not be climbing on for safety reasons, so I wanted something more appropriate for that urge.This came to my folks house quickly as promised, but my mom said wow she wished she had sent it to me because the box was way too heavy for my 60 something parents to carry from their front porch to their car, lol. Anyway, luckily all the parts were there the day they brought it to us on my son's birthday.We had a little party with a total of six children ages 2,4,5,6,7,and 11, oh yeah and my husband and 2 other adult men. The men had put together many of the yellow five armed star pieces over less than an hour, which left the bottom blue pieces in a large ring and the corresponding blue pieces connected the yellow pieces. So in about an hour I and the kids put the rest together and believe it or not it was a really fun activity. Everyone, okay everyone except our wild 2 year old, pitched in, holding pieces or screwing pieces together. A true group effort that I think the kids will all remember. And no pieces got lost! Afterwards my husband and friends tightened every bolt, which of course there are a lot. My point is, this is best as a group effort, you will definitely need two people just by virtue of someone holding assembled pieces while you screw them together into place.  I cannot imagine doing this alone, but maybe it is possible.  Probably would take you all afternoon :)The kids all loved it! Even the 11 year old wanted to try it out.  It is better for younger kids, I would say ages 2-6 ish, but don't be surprised if visiting kids or nieces and nephews that are older want to give it a go as well- I mean, it is a cool jungle gym right in your back yard.It has many possibilities for imaginative play, besides climbing, they play inside it, like to put sheets on it and play inside. We are not a TV oriented sort of family, we play outside every single day and usually 2 or 3 times if it is decent.  I can honestly say my kids, 2 and 4 1/2, play on this every day, all the time. And they have lots of toys/play stuff. This was a great gift!At two, my son is pretty nimble though of course not too careful. I actually thought he would climb right up this like a tree monkey, but it presented a healthy challenge to him and he was by no means mastering this thing in minutes like I envisioned. Which is great, it keeps him and his big sister and our friends' kids (ages 4-6) well occupied. Initially he needed a little stool underneath to hoist himself up on top of the first row of bars (and beyond).  He is average height. Now he wrangles himself right up. He is very determined!My mom was a little concerned that we should put woodchips down in case our son fell.  He is after all fearless and careless. But he has never fallen. The bars are just close enough together that he can climb around pretty confidently and always has a place to hold on. also the very top can't be much more than 4 feet off the ground.It seems VERY sturdy. I climbed on it, at 105 lbs, and it had no give at all. It really does seem as sturdy as something in a playground. I can imagine this thing lasting years and years. The pieces are very strong, come together tightly, and the paint seems thick and should last.Overall, I say go for it! It doesn't look super tacky in your yard and your kids should love it. And now it is like half off the original price, which is more than 50 bucks cheaper than what it was selling for 3 months ago. Your kids will love it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Assembly took awhile, but it was not to complicated. I think it is worth every peeny. I would not recomend this for children under 4 yrs of age!

B001CWMVC0,"[CLS] Funny game [SEP]"",""[CLS] works great [SEP]"",""[CLS] This looks like so much fun. If it had better directions it would be better. :/ [SEP]"",""[CLS] Originally posted at [...], a new idea everyday!Game-Trailer Park WarsPrice-$30Set-up/Play/Clean-up-1 hourProducer- Gut Bustin' GamesTL; DR- Great game not for all audiences 95%Basics-Get 'er Done!  Time to enter the exciting world of trailer park management in this game full of crude humor.  The Game starts by naming your trailer park by drawing tiles from three random stacks.  After naming your trailer park, you and all players get an equal number of trailers to manage that you arrange in a circle around your park name.  Once you have your trailer park set up, you draw cards and play.  Each turn you play three cards then draw up to five.  These cards are residents, events, or items for your park.  Residents are worth point.  These can be positive or negative as some residents do harmful things to your park like meth cooks.  Events are single use cards the steal residents, kill residents, or other random effects.  Items for the park are amenities such as a beer vending machine that give you points and prevent residents from getting DUI's.  After you play your cards, you get pink flamingos equal to the total number of points of your park.  When the last flamingo is drawn, the game is over and the person with the most points wins.Mechanics-This game is amazingly simple to play.  You play three cards, draw, and your turn is done.  The game is very random, so you may have the smartest strategy, but you could still lose hard.  Also, you have to be very perceptive to see where different cards can be played.  If you don't keep tabs on your opponents, you might lose this game quickly.  There are no mechanics besides players to keep winners in check.  Some of my friends complain that they can't see all the other players' boards very well.  Its fun, by it's not without its problems. 4/5Theme-This game oozes theme out of every pore. Lots of funny art, great text, and amazing pictures of trailers all make you think about the funniest redneck stereotypes.  Also, any game that starts by naming a trailer park is phenomenal.  It makes fun of rednecks with gusto.  I'm a redneck, so I find it amazingly funny.  However, you have to know who you will play with.  This game does have some not safe for work themes such as DUI's and other events that some players might find offensive.  I love it though! 5/5Instructions-This is another home run.  Any rules that start off by telling you to stop reading these stupid rules and start playing definitely make me think redneck.  Since the mechanics are simple, the rules don't have much to cover.  So, the rules spend most of their time being funny.  That's an excellent use of their space.  5/5Execution-I love this game through and through.  Great cards, funny art, plastic pink flamingos, and amazing trailer park pictures all combine to make this a well done game.  The box is nice, and fits all the pieces well. 5/5Summary-I love this game!  It's a great game for some quick fun with your friends who might be the same people you play Cards Against Humanity with.  This would NOT be the game you bring to church group, but this is the game you bring with you to your friends house and you sit around drinking Pabst when you don't want to think too hard.  If your friends don't admire toilet humor or want a seven hour euro game, this isn't the game for them.  Know who you're playing with and this is an awesome game. 95% [SEP]"",""[CLS] Tried a two-player game and one player got all the best good cards and best bad cards to play on me. Could never catch up or hurt her flamingo production enough to make a difference. The problem with having flamingos as the scoring mechanic means the game will end suddenly and clearly, with no chance for anyone else to steal the victory from whoever is in the lead. This sucks. Also problematic in the two-player version is there are way too many trailers, so your park never gets more than half-rented to residents even if you make an effort to fill it. The rules are vague and poorly written. Too many of the cards are too complicated to remember.  The trailer cards use actual photos of real trailers and are amusing to look at, but the residents and other cards use goofy, bad art which is distracting. Not much else I can say about this game except it isn't much better with 3 or more players. It's not horrible (so I'll rate it two stars instead of one), but there are way better games out there like Ticket To Ride, Dominion, Stone Age, etc., and I certainly have no interest in playing Trailer Park Wars again. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Our favorite thing about this game is the trailer cards.  They are such a hoot for people who are into this sort of thing.

B001E6UJLY,"[CLS] This is a fun little toy.  It has a real guitar shape and it does have little strings, though they don't do anything.  The keys on the neck of the guitar play different songs, and there is a whammy bar that makes a bendy note sound.  My 20 month old loves it, and I'm sure his older brother will too.  Definitely worth $20. [SEP]"",""[CLS] When I think of toys with bright, primary colors and music - it brings to mind words/phrases like annoying, obnoxious, overly pleasant, or perhaps dorky looking. This guitar is not any of those things. It makes other toys seem *condescending*.My son got this for his first birthday, and it was a big hit. He likes his grandpa's guitars, so it was important that a toy guitar for him had strings on it. He likes to pluck the strings, and hit the buttons - and he didn't even notice any of the other toys after we opened this one. It has been a couple months, and he still plays with it all the time - he dances and rocks back and forth like he his having the best time of his life. He hugs it. We haven't had to change the batteries yet.The songs aren't irritating (no peppy voices), it has two volume levels, and it lights up in an attractive/cool manner.I let him play around with the keyboard version in the store, and I think it would be as good as the guitar.The only negative thing I can think of, is that the sticker is getting grungy looking. It doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the toy, so it really isn't a big deal. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a great toy! My son received it for his 2nd birthday from a friend of mine, and he plays with it all the time. He actually already had a couple play guitars, but since this one joined his collection, he never touches the other two anymore. If you're at all interested, I absolutely recommend this. The songs are fairly current pop songs that most parents will recognize, and the actual strings will definitely be a big hit with many toddlers. Overall, a wonderful toy!

Our 3yo holds it like a steel guitar, and our 1yo uses it like Jimmy Hendrix on a major trip!  Either way, it's a lot of fun!  The volume is adjustable.  Regular and LOUD.  The loud setting can be annoying at the wrong time, but when it's time to really rock out, what's better than a loud guitar!  The regular setting is just fine for less silly times.  We've had ours for a couple of months, and it seems really durable.  It's been dropped and stepped on a lot, and it's still performing like it did when it came out of the box.

My daughter is of Korean, Finnish, and Mexican heritage and it's really difficult to find a doll that remotely resembles her, aside from her Bitty Baby.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] My daughter hasn't played with her dolly yet, but she was fascinated by the one my friends' daughter had (she couldn't really play with it, since 16-month-olds aren't keen on the concept of sharing yet).  I bought her the same one -- since I usually only see blonde baby dolls, I was happy to find that the Stella dolls make them in brunette.  I would've liked to find a Stella that had more Asian features (we're Japanese), but this was okay.  I do like the fact that she's machine-washable, and soft.  My little girl will be getting to play with hers at Christmas (YES, I bought this in advance), so I'll update the review then. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is an extra cute doll. It's quite a bit smaller than most and the way the pacifier sticks to the mouth with the magnet is really cute. We also got the feeding set with the bottle for the same reason. The Brunette version actually has black hair and very light skin and I think could be considered Caucasian or Asian.I would give this doll 5 stars except for the fact that after a few months the hair ties have loosened and the hair is always falling out of the little pig tails. Once the hair comes out it's difficult to get it back inside (I've had to use a rubber band to hold it in place) and it never lies flat again, it's all bunchy. My daughter says the doll's hair is 'messy' and dislikes it. I wish they sewed the pig tails into the doll so that they wouldn't shift or come out, that would solve the problem. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I ordered the Stella with black hair for my daughter.  The doll arrived with a totally different pacifier than is pictured.  Mine is a pink heart shape, with a purple flower sticker on it.  This one shows in more of a butterfly shape.  However, the MAIN problem is that my pacifier has a hole in the bottom.  It looks as if they didn't have quite enough material to stitch it correctly, so it was pulled too tight, and caused the material to stretch to the point of ripping.  This is a CHOKING HAZZARD, as there is a loose small magnet inside the pacifier.  Of course I was unable to give it to my 1 year old daughter to play with.  Also, the dolls diaper is stitched poorly, with a line of stitching meandering all over the place, including OFF the diaper, so that the fabric is unraveling.  I called Manhattan Toy Company first, to see if they could replace the diaper and the pacifier.  They were unable to do so, and suggested I return it to Amazon.  That is what I am doing, however, I wasn't impressed with their customer service.  The woman was completely uninterested in the fact that this was a choking hazzard, and didn't offer so much as an apology.  I would probably order another doll and hope I can get one in better shape, as my daughter really likes it.  However, I would warn you that the quality control may not be up to par, and the customer service could be better.

B001FPQ5Y4,"[CLS] A nice card game at a nice price . The whole game start to finish will take 10 to 15 minutes and it is fun [SEP]"",""[CLS] Monopoly Deal: 2-5 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 15-45 MinutesIt's fast, I'll give it that. My eleven year old son and I played a game and it was over before I knew what hit me. Setting up the game was easy and figuring out the rules took me less time than it normally takes for me to set up a game of Agricola...always a plus. The cards are both easy to read and easy on the eyes, making it possible to recognize what they do at a glance after playing the game a few times.I liked the idea of a bank pile being your defense against your opponent taking your property cards when charging rent. The problem that I ran into was that I didn't feel there were enough rent cards in the game to thoroughly deplete a person's bank pile. My son and I had a sizable stash saved up about five minutes into the game and it simply became a rush to see who drew the property cards they needed to win. The rent cards we played on each other barely dented our bank piles. I have been playing around with ideas in my head to balance this: one being to remove some of the money cards from the game or to buy a second game and put all of the rent cards from the second game into the first game. I have yet to test out these ideas, if I find something that works then I'll leave a comment below.There is a little bit of luck involved with drawing the right cards you need, but since this game doesn't take long to play, I can overlook it. Some games, the cards will be your best friend and other games, they'll pull you into a bathroom stall and give you nonstop swirlies until you're gasping for air. The sooner players accept that they won't always win because of this mechanic, the less frustrated that they'll be while playing.Both Vinnie Jr and I liked playing this game and I believe it'll be well received when I introduce it to the rest of the family. Monopoly Deal succeeds at being exactly what is sets out to be: a light, fun card game. This would make an excellent addition to family game night as well as serve as a good filler in between longer games. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This card game has made life alot easier for me. My 8 year old son just loves the board game; problem is I rarely have enough time to play a complete game with him. The Deal cards have allowed me the opportunity to play his favorite game with him more often. We both just love it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We play the game a different way than the instructions state and doubled the fun! Instead of playing till someone wins by getting 3 sets of properties, we play till the stack of 'draw cards' runs out. Then everything is added up just like in regular monopoly.... money + property = grand total. The person with the most grand total is the winner. I don't understand why this isn't the actual way to play/win the game. The instructions, as stated in the game, for winning was kind of strange. When played that way, we all felt short changed... even the person who won felt they really didn't win. Try playing this other way i discribed. It's more like the original monopoly and more realistic as to who the winner of the game really is.My 19 yr old loves this game as well as my 8 yr old. This is a great family game. My kids ask to play it every evening. When played according to the way I described, the game lasts about 30-40 minutes, at least twice as long as if played according to the instructions. The extra time is worth it though.... very fun. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a potentially fun idea.  The directions are a bit complicated and take some getting used to.We had thought the game was going to be a quick and easy version of the classic.

B001GMZR18,"[CLS] I give the Lego Tie fighter 2 stars.  It's cool, and fun to build, so worth more than a single star.  But it is meant to JUST sit on a shelf.  It falls apart at the slightest touch.  I helped my son put it together and it had pieces falling off as I was putting pieces on. Once assembled, if I (an adult) so much as pick it up it wants to fall apart.  And not just a stick the wing back on sort of thing, no, the wing falls off and takes a chunk of other bricks with it requiring disassembly and rebuild of a good sized section.  It's frustrating for me; I can't imagine how a child would feel.  As the time I'm writing this review the TIE Fighter is no longer being produced by LEGO so buyers are paying premiums with 3rd party dealers on Amazon or popular auction sites.  So, I suppose if you are a collector of Lego and want one of everything, fine.  But don't expect to play with it, or make movies, or any of the other fun things one DOES with Lego models other than stick them on a shelf. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a fantastic Lego Star Wars!  It makes an awesome Christmas gift!  My younger cousin is a huge Star Wars fan and has several of these sets.  The put the Tie fighter together with minimum help and it didn't take too long.  He was so happy to be able to play with it! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I remember when Star Wars first came out. it wasn't just THE thing it was everything. a friend and i tried hard to make the charactors and ships out of my vast collection of legos at the time. remember, this was the 1970s (that was LAST mellinium). we even took brown yarn and glued it on one of the classic bigger figures for chewbacca. what we did to make Darth's TIE fighter was even more hidious, we used duct tape!!! Now those days are past.....(sob) now i have this set to remind me of the good old days of a child's imagination. soon the movie blu rays will be out and all will be well again with the universe. Oh yeah, the set. looks great and fun to put together. i am going to have fun shooting it and watching it blow up with my X wing fighter3/6/11 DONEtook me a couple hours (and lunch) but it is finished. Cool thing about this set: there are a couple missles to shoot and a place undernieth for the light saber.I'd say the thing i like most about this set and legos in general is the while putting it together you don't know how the pieces work together until you are done. this is the case with this set in a big way. VERY cool set and very sturdy [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a super fun Lego set.  It is fun to build and comes with Darth Vader and his light saber.  Once everything is together it stays together pretty well so you can play with it.My husband actually built it, but my 4 year old son likes to play with it.  Occasionally the wings fall off or the light saber falls out of the holder in the bottom, but both things are easy to put back together, so its not a huge deal.The tie-fighter itself has neat functionality, Darth Vader fits well in the pilots seat and the front opens and closes easily.Not the best set for a young child to put together and not the best if your kid is into rough pretend play.  But it stays together well enough for some occasional pretend play and was fun to put together. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The wings on this Tie Fighter fold in, and the cockpit opens up to hold Darth Vader himself.  Awesome.  There is a clip underneath for Vader's light saber.These wings are much, much more durable and less prone to fall apart than the wings on the Hyena Droid Bomber, although of course they transform less -- these wings are hinged.  Lego has the hinges down to a good science -- they are easy to build and hold up well under play conditions.This is a great toy for the money -- lots of play time on this one.  Not too challenging, but enough pieces to be really fun to build. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I got this set for my birthday, and I was thrilled because I had really wanted a Darth Vader figure for my Lego collection. This set comes with one awesome Darth Vader figure that has a very detailed printed head and torso. He also has a black cape and a fantastic helmet. He is equipped with a silver lightsaber hilt with a red blade. The TIE Fighter itself is a fairly complex build and when finished it looks very fast and intimidating. The TIE Fighter is equipped with an opening cockpit with a seat and controls for Darth Vader. The ship is outfitted with two flick-missiles (one on each side of the cockpit) that have a mechanism to shoot them. The Fighter also has a holder for Vader's lightsaber behind the cockpit. Well, here are the basics of the set:The good thingsDarth VaderLightsaberTIE FighterMechanism to shoot the flick-missilesLightsaber holderOpening cockpitPrinted cockpit control piecePrinted windshield pieceThe bad thingsStickersFlick-missilesCockpit needs more controlsVader can not fit in the cockpit with his cape onOver all, I highly recommend this set.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] Nice looking ship. Looks good when built. Easy to build but nicely crafted. Small quibble-could use an extra piece under the cockpit to secure it better(which I've done with an extra piece I had from another lego set). Also both side wings(panels)could use a tighter bond but overall a fine addition to any Star Wars lego collection.PRO's-Ship design, Darth Vader mini-figure, wings tilt and straighten, cockpit design and underneath ship a small peg/click to hold/attach Darth Vader's light saber.CON's-Needs another small flat 2x3 brick plate to help secure under cockpit better so when you put in Vader, it won't separate the cockpit (easy fix). Wings need perhaps a couple more technique pegs to secure a tigher bon(again, easy fix).Overall with some minor tweaks it's a fun ship. Recommended and Highly Recommended for any Star Wars fan or Darth Vader fan. [SEP]",[CLS] Pieces: 251 [SEP],https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51dnUTMhdJL.jpg
B001GN3FXY,"[CLS] Bought this for my nephew.  He loves it. Encourages him to use his imagination. Legos are fantastic for children! (Please make sure you buy the appropriate legos per age group.) [SEP]"",""[CLS] I purchased this set basically because it was cheap (I bought it on sale for $[...]) and because I liked the figures. This comes with three new rocket battle droid figures which have dark gray arms and legs, and dark orange heads and torsos. That rocket battle droids are equipped with short blasters and jetpacks. The Hyena Droid Bomber itself is a very interesting build and when finished it looks very big and intimidating. The Bomber is equipped with a four bomb payload which can be dropped in twos by pulling back two levers on the back of the ship. The Hyena can be placed in standing position by folding the wings out and down and in attack position by folding the wings out and up. The Hyena can also be placed in normal flying position by folding the wings in and up. The Hyena's head can also swivel up and down, and there is a targeting sight (sticker) on the bottom of the ship. Well, here are the basics of the set:The good thingsThree rocket battle droidsShort blastersJetpacksHyena Droid BomberFour bombsBomb releaseStanding positionFlying positionAttack positionSwiveling headThe bad thingsStickersOver all, I very highly recommend this set. [SEP]"",""[CLS] OK, as a mom, may I just say that it is extremely cool that this Lego set has so many moving parts?  The bomber's wings shift and transform -- it is absolutely amazing.  My son put this together in a little over an hour and he enjoyed every minute of it.We've had the toy for three days now and I'm not sure Lego has got the transforming bit of this toy right.  Normal play with the toy leads to repeated disintegration of the wings -- they just fall off the bomber.  If you have a child like my little guy, no problem -- reconstructing the thing is most of the joy.  But I can see some serious agony in houses where the toy is supposed to stay together.Anyway, it is immensely cool to look at and build, and in theory it is just awesome.  It would be better if it were less delicate. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Overall this is another good Star Wars set from Lego. Could use some improvement but it's slight. For instance the color scheme of the dark grey brick against the dark blue need some lighter grey bricks (ala the Armored Assault Tank). Also too many stickers which could be replaced with unique brick parts.Pros.- 4 bombs (which use a simple clever mechanism for dropping), Wings that open/close and tilt to a walker vehicle, tilting bridge sections, 3 jet pack Battle Droids.Cons.-Too many stickers, color scheme.

It turned out very pretty. Once she was done she had the pretty horse to add to her collection to play with. She really enjoyed that. It felt like it was of good quality.The only reason I didn't give it the full five stars is because I felt like it shouldve come with more markers. She was very limited, and I know she wouldve liked it better if it had come with seven or even five markers. Other than that, she enjoyed it and I would recommend it.

I am sure my granddaughter will love it [SEP]"",""[CLS] All in all I was very pleased with the kit. I ordered this for a little girls 13th birthday 3 days before the party (had just found out) who was a friend of my daughter that loves and owns horses. I called her mother and found out she collects the pre-made Breyer horses and I asked and she said she had never had one of those kits to paint your own before so that is what I decided to get for her.(figure this way she can paint it like HER horse make it more special than the bought figurines)I was hesitant after reading several comments on multiple different horse painting kits. There were some pretty bad things saying they were tiny, they did not get the paint or it was dry and unusable, or that the horse came with a broken piece or something missing. It was not an easy choice but eventually I decided to go with one of the larger horses and one that had a full array of paint colors not just two or three.Apprehensive when the box arrived I opened it and unwrapped the horse to make sure it was all there and not broken and to my surprise it was in perfect condition, huge and everything was there so well packed that it took me five minutes to get into see if it was all there. (That was a good thing, thus why it made shipping without breaking) When it first arrived my own daughters said that they wanted one too for their birthdays as well they liked it so much.It came VERY well packed, all in one piece nothing broken and it arrived quickly on time the day before the party. It was a big success, it seems it had been her favorite present she opened that day, she even squealed when she opened and saw what it was. So now I plan to get one each for my daughters to paint their own when their own birthdays roll around because they are not terribly high priced at all. About what you would pay for just about any toy/item for a teenager. Plus I think it would be a great way to let my girls express themselves artistically.Great Buy 5 stars!

The joint connections are loose and terrible.  The plastic isn't very stiff, and it's sad because it looks SO cute.  Much better colors than the others, but beware.  You'll put yourself on a cold, lonely island by buying this.  If you get Marbulous, Edushape and Lakeshore sell other Marbulous, so you've got compatibility there.

And in terms of sturdiness, nothing beats Marbleworks, but it has less pieces and gets boring faster.  Skip this generic, please.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] First, we have another marble track set, and our kids love it. I was looking for something with more bells and whistles, so I bought this.  Here's what you NEED TO KNOW:1) If you have any REGULAR STANDARD SIZE marbles, they WILL NOT FIT. WILL NOT. NO WAY. you have to use the tiny little plastic balls they give you, and even a few of those get stuck.2) This will NOT stay together, no matter how hard you try, so don't go out of your mind.3) It's flimsy and the pieces get warped, or arrive warped.  Good luck with that.So if you have any intention of using REAL MARBLES, you can't use this.  I love the concept, I love the colors and the different tracks, but why would you create a marble track that CAN NOT USE REAL MARBLES??  Doesn't that defy logic?  Yes, of course it does.Buy another set.  There are tons to choose from.  I don't even remember the name of our good set, or I would recommend it.It's a shame, this could have been out of this world if the creators had spent a little more time, and used some common sense. [SEP]"",""[CLS] When I first got it out of the box I was a bit dismayed that the pieces didn't seem to be very good quality or have a strong interlock system but once we got going with it, I started to change my opinion. The pieces don't fit together extremely tightly and it can get a bit wobbly once you get into the big structures but it's not bad if you're careful not to knock it over. And if you do, the pieces don't go far or damage anything. For a novice it looks confusing at first but it's quite easy to figure out and I was very impressed that within about ten to fifteen minutes play my 3 year old had managed to build a maze of her own after watching me put one together from the diagram. It's the only toy/game I've seen her so engrossed in that she will completely ignore the TV, even if one of her favorite shows is on. I might not be so impressed if I had paid the full retail price for it but we found it for about 50% less at Toys R Us.I think this is probably better for the younger in the age range as it's not very sophisticated but my only real caution would be to closely supervise use for young kids because the colored plastic marbles that come with it look an awful lot like candy.March 2013 - Edited to add I could not have been more wrong about this being more suited to the younger age group. Over two years after purchase this has remained one of my daughter's favourite toys. She is not at a stage where she can build a functional smaller maze by herself or a alrger, more sophisticated one with parental help. This is one of the best and most enduring toys we have bought.

Great price for what you get ($20).4. It has some cool track pieces. We especially like the looping one.Cons:1. Some of the plastic building pieces don't fit together well at all.2.

The joining pieces simply not joining and the force behind the attempt eventually pinching my hands, fingers and toes [not really my toes], giving me blood blisters all over.After frustratingly pegging this contraption together, you put the small plastic balls in. Yes, small plastic balls. Not marbles, but small plastic balls. What does this make this toy then? A small plastic ball race... not... a marble race. Real marbles of regular size don't even fit in this item, let alone come with it as the MindWare marble run does.This one, also, amazingly, falls apart easily. All the pieces in between the feet on the bottom and the big round red funnel on the top barely squeeze together, but the feet slip out from under it like nothing else and the top flips off constantly with very little effort from myself or my son.Needless to say, I threw it out.A year later [aka, a month ago] I purchased the MindWare marble run from Amazon. I was wary, but the reviews were stunning. Tried it out and my son loves it.I am disappointed in Imaginarium for this product. It doesn't seem they've tested it out at all. I have two train sets from Imaginarium that my son loves and they've lasted. This item simply isn't up to par.I say, buyer beware! Get a different marble set. Either the incredibly expensive wooden marble sets, or, my now favorite, the MindWare marble set. My son played with it for three hours straight today and can't get enough... this one he was done with, frustrated AND crying within ten minutes. Yes, he's older, but he'd also had experience with a MindWare marble set before that and loved it.Not worth it. Certainly not worth 40 dollars as it is currently listed.

B001JTAZPG,"[CLS] We purchased this wagon for our daughter on her first birthday, and have really enjoyed it and gotten a lot of use out of it. We wanted a nice wagon, but didn't need a lot of extras. This one was perfect for that. It has two seats, so our daughter can ride with a friend. And there is a seat belt for each child. There is also a convenient place for drinks and snacks. We live on a second floor, and this wagon is easy for me to carry up and down, even at only 5' tall. We have been all over in this wagon, and even at almost two-years-old now, our daughter loves it just as much. This is a great choice for a fun outdoor toy.

It has cup and juice box holders, seat belts ( I did not install these, but it would be good for a younger child), and rolls easily. It has 2 seats which are plenty big for him, and I think it should fit him for many more years. Great wagon. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This was a gift for my cousin at her baby shower.

It is exactly what we wanted since her girls are too big for a stroller, but they ride easily in the wagon. My thought was the baby carrier could sit in the middle while they hold on to the carrier handle. As he grows he will be able to sit in the seats since it has set belts.The seats are comfortable. The cup holders are a bonus too. It's easy to pull & has not been difficult to maneuver on gravel, cement, grass, or dirt so far. I particularly like that the handle folds underneath for storage!

[SEP]"",""[CLS] This is my third Step 2 product and all of them so far have been well-designed and fun for our daughter. This is no exception. I was pleasantly surprised how deep and long the wagon was. Now my daughter is just 22 months and on the small side. But her and a 3 year old friend both get in and have plenty of room. I also like that there are safety waist straps on both sides.Assembly is pretty straight forward but we did run into a couple of problems. Throughout the assembly you are asked to use a hammer to get end pieces on. While doing this the metal flattened out and expanded on the rear axle making it impossible to put on. We considered calling Step 2 and I am sure they would have been great. But instead we bought a $7 metal file from Wal-Mart and filed the end down. It then worked ok. BUT be sure to use the provided brace on the opposite end so the axel is pushed up as far as possible when putting on the second rear wheel.Once assembled very pleased with the operation. It is easy to both push and pull and the wheels are very smooth. One design flaw though. The side for drinks is very roomy. All of our sippy cups fit with ease. The other side is supposed to be for chip bags or books. It is much too shallow. Bizarre oversight. It is basically useless.In the end we decided on this over the cozy coupe for added verticality and we are not disappointed. You might not have any assembly problems and the assembly is not hard. We found a workaround fairly easily for our problem. Aside from the way too shallow 'chip holder' all other aspects of the wagon are well-designed. I also like the color, a true fire engine red.

B001KPOKDC,"[CLS] I love Star Trek. When I heard they were going to reboot the series starting back at the beginning, I was looking forward to seeing familiar characters, which as far as many trek fans are concerned, include the ship and props. But this tricorder is so off base it's rediculous. The original tricorder was a reasonable size, it contained the knowledge of the ship, it had a TV screen and interchangeable data disks, which makes sense. This little thing is so small and impractical, it's rediculous. There are a few episodes where the view screen on the tricorder is necessary. Now if the crew is going to relive those adventures, how can this thing help...there isn't even a view screen on it. And it is so small, if there was one, they're gonna need a lot of Retinax to be able to see it. I can understand updating the equipment, but though the Enterprise was updated, it was still recognizable as the Enterprise. This is totally unrecognizable as a tricorder. [SEP]"",""[CLS] as described [SEP]"",""[CLS] This review will look at this from two different perspectives.  First, from the standpoint of a toy.  Second, from the actual subject matter.The toy is...  well, it's not much.  It's a little box with a couple of LEDs and two buttons, each of which cycles through just a couple of sounds, which play for just a few moments.  How much play value can you get from that?Art Asylum did, at about the same time, several variations of the TOS (the original series) tricorder... a science, a medical, and a geological tricorder.  Each has multiple modes, much more interesting electronics (including recorded speech from the original actors) and removable accessories.  They are very accurate to what was used in the show (not quite studio quality, but really good nevertheless) and also have a LOT of play value.Of course, to be fair, the tricorder was only used once in the movie.  And this was as an iPhone, not as what a tricorder really is (see the scene right after the alternative Kirk is stranded on the snow planet...  he uses it to record his diary).I suspect that Playmate decided not to spend much on doing this, because they probably (and I'd argue, correctly) realized that this wasn't going to be much of a market.  The Art Asylum props sell very well, but the Playmates ones (the recent ones, I mean) didn't sell well at all and ended upon clearance tables everywhere.  Playmates probably recognized this too late, and decided to save on their initial expenses.The tricorder in the original series is three devices.  It's a portable high-end computer.  It's a portable high-power sensor platform.  And it's a portable data library and recorder.  (And in later series... TNG and forward...  it also had the ability to network with the ship's computers, though this was never part of the TOS version's functions).  It's a tri-function  computer/scanner/recorder...  or tricorder for short.The problem is that the guys who did the original series understood technology better than the guys who did this movie.  The new guys don't think about WHY thinks work... only what would be cool?  So, they think that a communicator should be like a cell phone, and a tricorder should be like an iPad.But...  remember, a cell phone is a low-power, short-range transceiver.  It is useless without a network of cellular towers to support it.  A communicator is more like the huge arrays used by NASA to talk with spacecraft than it is like a cell phone.Similarly, a tricorder isn't just a cool little electronic interface with buttons which can play your music and play video games.  That's ONLY the user interface.  The SENSOR functionality of this device was always at the core of what a tricorder was to be.  JJ Abrams and his team of artists have no grasp of science (clearly shown by the new movie), unlike the original production team did.  They have no concept of ergonomics, or functional design, unlike Matt Jefferies and Wah Chang did.  The devices, sets, etc, which they made simply make no sense.  But they look cool I guess.Could the original Tricorder design be updated?  Yes!  But is this what an updated tricorder design should be like?  Absolutely not.  This is like a child's version of a kewl airplane design, which doesn't meet the most basic rules of aerodynamics (and Jefferies was an aerospace designer, remember).Ignore this prop.  If you really like the new movie, pretend that they have a real tricorder there...  similar in function and capability to the original, but with a cleaned-up user interface.  Not this idiotic Ipad with flippy parts thing. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a toy - or for something to use with a costume - and not a collectable.  The price reflects that.

B001KW063I,"[CLS] The Crayola Glow Station possesses a very high coolness factor that will appeal to kids. I mean, who doesn't enjoy stuff that glows in the dark? That you can create the glow-in-the-dark fun yourself only adds to the allure. Run the light wand over the Glow Station's surface and voila! A glowing masterpiece.COMPONENTS:The Glow Station itself is a sheet of light-sensitive plastic material of approximately 21 by 15 framed at the top and bottom by two plastic bars that can hold some of the pieces that come with the set. There is no solid back on the Glow Station, so it can be rolled up for storage.The light wand has an LED at one end and comes with a crystal-like attachment for making stars. The light wand takes 3 AAA batteries.The set includes 14 positive/negative stencils and two printed acetate texture sheets with a dozen textures that can be combined with the stencils to make intriguing designs.Included is a dry erase marker and a blank acetate sheet for creating your own artwork. Rub the light wand over your design and the glow-in-the dark negative will form on the Glow Station surface.The quality of the components is good, though the glow-in-the-dark surface is a little flimsier than one might hope.PLAY:Use the light wand with or without the crystal attachment to form glowing designs through freehand, stenciled, and textured drawing.PROS:*Glows in the dark--always fun*The stencils and textures add thoughtful variety*The components are well designed*Contains hooks to hold the acetate sheets and positive stencils, and a small bin to hold the negative stencils*Will keep kids focused on an activity for a good whileCONS:*To reach its maximum effectiveness, the Glow Station needs to be in the dark for several minutes before using, making an antsy wait for some kids*Needs a dark room, so if you don't have one, you're out of luck*Contains an opening at top for holding the Glow Station, so you need a nail or other kind of hook to support it upright (as the Station does not have a solid backing to support itself)*The dry erase marker is not for use directly on the glow-in-the-dark surface--and we all know what happens when you mix kids and don't do this (though I am unsure whether the marker can be removed from the surface or not, as I was unwilling to test it)*The designs may fade faster than kids likeTHE BIG CON:* This is one of those the manufacturer didn't try the final product errors that drives parents batty. The glow-in-the dark surface has a large sticker on its front side that gives some final warnings and instructions. Rather than make this sticker easily removable, Crayola made it out of paper. It readily tore in tiny pieces or had the paper come away from the adhesive, leaving a mess that took a half hour of scraping and cajoling with a fingernail to remove. As I was unsure whether the surface would hold up under the kinds of solvents that might remove the adhesive, I was left with a real chore--while my kid was dying to use the toy. A plastic sticker could have been removed in one piece, so why did Crayola opt for this cursed paper sticker that left behind a mess and a scarred surface (as the scraping with my fingernail left scratches in the Glow Station's surface)? How I would love for the Crayola management team to suffer through that same inane sticker-removing process.CONCLUSIONS:Cons aside, this is a fine toy that will delight (pun intended) children, and even a few big kids. The price--around $25--is good, too. Even those kids who may not be into drawing will be drawn in by the glow-in-the-dark fun.UPDATE:A few people have commented that I failed to remove the clear, protective film from the Glow Station's surface, and that doing so avoids the struggle with the paper label. That's absolutely true. I checked and the film was still on ours. The nearly invisible film does peel away from the surface with a solid pull.In my defense, it's impossible from looking at the unit to see that it has a protective film, nor did I immediately notice any reference to removing that film in either the instructions or the paper label. That's not to say they aren't there, only that they weren't quickly apparent, especially when a very eager child is wanting to play right away. Crayola could make this more apparent.So bump up the stars by one. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My boys love this toy.  You don't have to touch the board, simply wave the light wand over the stencils or pretend to write.  Maybe the board has been improved upon, because while I was worried that it would require some kind of charging by holding it near the light, it does not.  It's not like glow in the dark stickers or stars.  It's the wand that makes the surface of the board glow.  The pictures hold out long enough for my boys.  It's very similar to the Aqua Doodle in that it takes time to fade like the Aqua Doodle takes time to dry.My 3 year old and my 2 year old both enjoy this toy.  Our only problem so far is that we only have one. And for such a reasonable price, this won't be a problem for long. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My daughter received this as a Christmas gift this past weekend.  It's awesome!  You can draw with it in the light but what you draw disappears almost immediately...walk into the dark with it and you can still see everything that has apparently disappeared while in the light.  Just like one reviewer said...it is a glow station meaning in the dark!  I think it's very clever and the kids love it!

It does work with out complete darkness and yes it does fade quickly which is why I think younger children will enjoy it.  What I have noticed is that it is hard to draw well with the light pen as whenever the pen approaches the board it makes a glow circle as it approaches which I think would frustrate children that can draw.  It is very hard to do any real pictures or writing due to this issue.  Younger kids do not mind as they scribble or do circles and then laugh about the cool neon green color they created.  My friend and I tried to write basic names and were not impressed with how they turned out so if your child is a perfectionist and wants to make pictures that are even slightly complicated I would not suggest this toy.  Otherwise it is a wonderful toy to use before bed or just to waste time when parents need a little bit of time to accomplish .

[SEP]"",""[CLS] I despise these horrid little things.  First off, you have to remove the nozzle and take out the stopper before you use each tube.  This would be a minor annoyance except that some of the nozzles in my set flat-out refused to come off, no matter how much I twisted, pulled, twisted in the other direction, or pried.  So now we have tubes of glitter glue we can't use.  And second, the tubes are so tiny that my daughter can use them up in 5 minutes.  Because the tubes are so small, the volume to surface area ratio is very poor, which means a disproportionate amount of the glue ends up clinging to the inside of the tube, where we can see it, but we can't get it out.  The colors sure are attractive, but when you can only get a few squeezes (or none at all) out of them, I don't see the point. [SEP]"",""[CLS] These are small markers with a small amount of glitter glue in each. This was perfect for my 4 year old. She could easily squeeze out the glitter.

I know it is meant for older children but it kind of frustrated my son when he couldn't get it to stand up.  Also getting the missle to shoot, doesn't work all that well.

I wish it had been in a stiff package but the plastic (not wood) it's made of will flex w/out breaking during shipping.  Pay attention to which way you spin it. The wings are bent to provide a much better response in one direction. If you're getting a bad reaction...wind it up the other way and make sure it's wound tight!  FUN toy.

Made many students and fellow teachers shriek!!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Bought this for my daughter after seeing the video ad of a similar butterfly flying out of a greeting card. I tried doing that for her and it didn't really work... it mostly just flew out a foot or so and then down to the floor, not upward. But she liked it anyway and kept winding it up and making it fly-- sometimes it actually flew up into the air and sometimes it didn't go far. Either way, for an inexpensive item, I'm glad it's lasted this long-- it's made at least a dozen flights without breaking. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This cheap trick from China should cost $1 or less.

A game we could include all ages with, from the near three year old to the eight year old.It has excellent illustrations and tells what the plant aids with, it just doesnt detail the how, how you would apply, ingest etc the plant in order to cure, as the creators mention in the instructions, there simply was not room to be a reference book on the deck of cards :)My favorite part?!  Best for last, to win the family, each person, had to think of all the other players, aiding them with the plant curing cards as the game progresses with the object being EVERYONE has to reach the end before its game over!  Not cool because everybody wins, cool because everyone has to think of all not just very man for himself in this game. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a wonderful game for learning traditional folk remedies for common herbs.The board and cards are high quality and very colorful.  The kids I've played it with grasp the differences between the herbs very quickly (much more quickly than the parents and adult helpers did).Truth in lending, my adult gamers were unimpressed, but if you are looking for a fun, educational game for the 8-12 category then this is raw gold.If you are looking to fill out your adult game library then this is likely not the best fit. [SEP]"",""[CLS] we love this game. 3 generations playing and we learned so much. our 7yr old grandson just loves the whole idea of getting those berries and bringing them to grandmas house. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a great, fun way to learn about herbs and wild foods, not only for kids but parents too! The cards are well illustrated and can be used to play match as well or used in other ways. A friend and I used them to do a little activity for our homeschool co-op. Identifying the plants in our property and locating problem cards to match the plants we have on our property. Many ways you can edit the game to fit your needs and have more fun or to suit your child's needs. It is a cooperative game so it's not about winning or loosing but about working together and racing to beat the end of the day. The more people you have the harder it actually is because you hit more moon spaces so it is more challenging to get home before dark.  My kids are 6 and 9 and have been playing this for a few years now and they still love it and it changes for them each time they play.

B001N11OI2,"[CLS] This is one of those nonsense games that you can play at a family gathering for those that just want to sit around the table.  It takes a few minutes for new players to read the cards and catch on to the nonsense portion, but we have played this with all ages 9 and above and everyone is willing to play at least 5-6 rounds.  Definitely not a strategy game in any way, just read the card and figure out which one to play [SEP]"",""[CLS] Hahaha  This game is super funny.  You have to play with good sports, though, who don't take it seriously.  One game can be over with the very first turn!  You can lose or win for the silliest of reasons.  Each game play is different, but the cards can seem a bit repetitive to me.  There is very very little strategy in this game.  Anything goes, anything can happen. Game play is generally under 10 minutes.  Works well, I think, in groups 4-8, but can be played in larger or small groups.  The cards are black and white like the box, suggesting its generic-ness.  :P [SEP]"",""[CLS] Great gift [SEP]"",""[CLS] This game didn't make sense at first but it's essentially a game of changing the rules.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] This game is great for in between games, when half of your party are out smoking or eating. Games really do only last 30 seconds sometimes, and I think our longest game was around 4 minutes. It is fun, hilarious, and well worth the money. [SEP]"",""[CLS] What an interesting game! I purchased this as a present for my sister. Her 13-year-old son instantly opened it and started a game with a couple people, including my grandmother who is 83. It was a fast learned game. If you have ever played Killer Bunnies, I would say it is similar yet completely different. There are some crazy rules. Some cards that you play say that no one can say certain words like I or me. One card says if someone goes out of the game, the person to their left loses as well. Be careful if you play this card, because you might be the person to the left when this happens!Here is my personal favorite example of this game. My nephew got a card that told him to put his finger on his nose. Anyone who did not put their finger on their nose within 3 seconds was out. This got one person out of the game. A game or so later, he got a card that told him to put his finger on his nose again. This time, anyone that put their finger on their nose lost! This won him the game. You really never know what's going to happen in this game, and that's why it's fun. There is a very slight chance that people will actually earn points in order to win, but I've yet to see that happen. It has the potential to be a somewhat longer game, but it is often a pretty short one. I liked this one enough that I think I might end up buying it for myself for future game nights. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Maybe you have to drink to like this game and because I don't drink I just don't get it.  I admit that I tried it in a small group setting, but we just didn't get into the game. Now I'm gun shy to suggest it to a big group because I don't want everyone wondering why I think something so dumb could be fun. [SEP]","[CLS] The most aptly named game ever. In this exceptionally silly and awesome game, your objective is to win. Simple enough. Sadly, all of your opponents have the same simple goal and they are trying to make you lose. Between rock paper scissors battles, being eaten by a random dragon or saved by a kitten ambush, there are many hazards to avoid. Games last between 30 seconds and 5 minutes (if you play slow) and specifically engineered to fit in maximum fun. Any number can play, though we recommend between 2 and 15. Rumors of 20 person games swirl around the Internet. The chaos pack expansion is included and contains a side deck of 15 new cards you can use alongside your copy of the full game. Every game, you randomly draw one chaos card and it becomes a rule that must be followed for the entire game. The 2 blank chaos pack rule cards are also included.

Throughout a three week long incubation, hens incubate and rotate their eggs, fertilized or not. Living up to a decade, chickens generally stay on land but have been known to fly in short bursts. As a flock, chickens abide by a pecking order. This way, the dominant birds always get first choice. Fun Facts: Internationally, there are more chickens than any other fowl.

B001O2S6MM,"[CLS] We've had this toy for over a year, purchased in a store for less than half the listed price when it first came out. At the listed price, I don't know I would buy this because it is a flimsy plastic trailer attached to a metal Mack that didn't even seem worth $20 in the store. If you line Mack up with Red (the larger diecast one from Disney) - their faces are about the same size (so that should indicate to you just how tiny this hauler really is) - though Mack's hat adds some height.That said, it is one of my almsot three year old's favorite toys. He has taken it to bed with him many nights, with Lightening tucked away inside. The larger diecast Lightening does fit (albeit snuggly) inside. While as a parent I think this looks cheapo, the kid adores it. And surprisingly, for all the play time logged - it hasn't broken. I expected the pull out to be the first to go (made of seemingly fragile plastic) but it hasn't snapped off - nor has the connector between Mack and the trailer. I am pleasantly surprised in that regard.I would recommend the Mack Hauler for any kid that loves Cars and is fascinated with big rigs.The only draw back is that at two, my son could not open and close the trailer or attach the trailer to Mack without assistance, if you don't mind having to re-attach the trailer several times an hour - not a biggie. Now my son can work the trailer himself, though he still needs my help at times to line the trailer up and attach to Mack, but this would be an issue with any big rig that has a separate trailer. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I don't think there were dimensions listed when I ordered this and it's much smaller than expected especially since I paid $30!  My son actually likes a $12 one from Target better!  The back end of this one is much more difficult for him to open and the trailer keeps detatching from the truck as he plays with it.  I think there are much better values out there for the money. [SEP]"",""[CLS] First off, buy MACK as your children will love him!!!!!  I do want to note that there are 2 versions of Mack on Amazon.com.  I bought the one that the back of Mack simply opens & you can put cars into the trailer; however, this Mack appears to offer a little more on the trailer.  It looks like you can open it up & it has a ramp/etc.  The other one (the one I bought does not).At first I was upset I didn't know this one was offered, but you know what?  Our little one ABSOLUTELY LOVES the MACK he has & knows no different.  Had I known this one was offered too I would probably have purchased it; however, I'm very happy w/ the one I did buy.  It makes me very happy when something brings so much joy to the children.This is the favorite out of everything we bought from the movie CARS.  MACK brings a lot of enjoyment to our house.I've read several negative reviews about it being plastic, but I don't see any problems w/ that what so ever.  Actually it is a bit safter.  If it was metal it would be heavy & you'd have to worry about it dropping on toes/etc.  Also, while it does seem a little flimsy - this is played w/ everyday & a lot through the day & we've had no problems.HIGHLY recommend! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 3 year old son has had great fun with this guy.  He likes to give his other cars rides and has had hours and hours of pretend play logged with this one.

B001OH9EDW,"[CLS] This is the game for those creative types out there that don't like the high strategy games. I have also found that my 6 year old daughter really enjoys the story telling aspect. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We have played this game twice now, with groups of 6 adults.  Until everyone plays a few hands and really understands the concept, they tend to recoil a bit and act like it's a dumb game, but as soon as they figure it out they really seem to like it.  By the end of each game (different set of people) everyone really liked it.It's best with friends who have good imaginations. The friends with little imagination tend to fail quite miserably in both describing and guessing roles, leaving them far behind in points with no hope of catching up.  So, if your gaming friends are a bit dull in that department, you might consider a different game. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a great game that I have wanted to own for awhile now. I finally bought it and I am so glad I did! Dixit is great for groups of not-hardcore gamers who just want to relax, laugh, and have fun. I love to play deep strategy games so it's been hard for me to find games that everyone likes. Dixit is one of those rare games that everyone enjoys. You need imagination, fun friends, and a willingness to laugh at yourself and your friends. Not as silly or uproarious as apples to apples but kind of the same concept, but much more artsy. Fun. Overall. Buy it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We gave this to our 7 year-old daughter on her birthday last week. We have played it every day at least once. I knew nothing about Dixit before I purchased it other than what was written in the description and the reviews.So we are thrilled that this is one family game that was a huge hit. This game is like no other in that you do not need to read but you do need an imagination. There are 84 picture cards which are a cross between picture book illustrations and Salvador Dali paintings. Nothing is straightforward and there are lots of bits and pieces and oddities in every picture. For example, a man, half buried in sand, conducting a tree branch full of birds. Your job as the storyteller is to say a phrase, sentence, sing a song, make a gesture or whatever you think will convey what your chosen picture is about. Since others cannot see it, it is up to their imagination to think about what you are trying to share. All other players that are not the storyteller, select a card from their hand that may fit the storyteller's description. The object is to confuse the other players into thinking that your card is the one that matches the storyteller's.All cards are then placed face up on the table and everyone (except for the storyteller) votes for the card that they think is the storyteller's based on the description. If you choose the correct card, you move forward in the game. If someone else chooses your 'fake' card, you move ahead.The really funny parts come when you have no cards that come even close to the storyteller's and you have to choose something to put in the pile of choices.My kids crack up at the hilarity of it all and we have a great time.The more you play, the easier it is to make up 'stories' for the pictures. We often don't keep track of scoring because it is just more fun to keep storytelling than it is to worry about who is winning.My kids are 7 and 11 and although the 7 year old is at a disadvantage when it comes to pop culture, she does a great job keeping up.Highly recommended for kids and adults of all ages. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I played Dixit at a couple of Game Meetups here in NYC. It's a twist on Apples to Apples in that each player takes turns giving a description of what he/she is looking for. Everyone then submits one of their picture cards. The idea is to guess which card belongs to the description giver. Voting for the right card moves you ahead. Voting for the wrong card moves the person who submitted it ahead. First person to reach the finish line wins.There's an expansion set already out for this game, so it's pretty popular. A fun party type game that's easy to learn and everyone plays on each turn, so there's no sitting around waiting. Highly recommended. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I am a fourth grade teacher and I use a lot of educational games in my classroom. In fact, I teach classes throughout the year on games teachers can use to spice up their lessons and increase student interest in what they are teaching. Dixit was a game that was offered to me at a discount because a local game store (CR Toys) had used it as a Demo and they marked it 60% off the MSRP.At any rate, it sat at the bottom of my class games pile for quite awhile until I decided to just step up and use it. In my class, we always start with me giving the students a demonstration of how to play the game and then I have a few students play with me while the others watch and, together, we learn by doing.In the beginning, the students seemed to not like the game. The basic rule of how to play seemed a bit strange to them and they had a hard time latching onto the idea. However, as the game rolled on, everyone was enjoying the game and realized how much fun it truly is. It is the first game students want to play during indoor recess now or if they finish work early.The game comes with 84 large cards. Each card has a beautiful, bizzare, interesting, amazing, or simple painting by artist Marie Cardouat. Each player gets six cards and one player begins as the storyteller. What the storyteller does is creates a sentence, phrase, title, sound effect, word, etc. to go with ONE of the images in their hand. For example, I might look at one of my cards and think Aesop's Fractured Fables. I then pull that card out without showing anyone. Everyone else looks at their cards and tries to pick an image that closely matches what the storyteller said and gives that card to the storyteller (without anyone, including the storyteller) seeing.The storyteller shuffles the cards and flips them face up on the table. Each person (except the storyteller) secretly votes on which image they think belongs to the storyteller. If EVERYBODY or NOBODY votes for the storytellers image, then everyone moves 2 spaces except the storyteller, who does not move. However, if at Least 1 person votes for the storytellers card (but not everyone) then the storyteller gets to move 3 spaces as does everyone who picked the correct card.In addition, each player gets to move one bonus space for every player who picked their image (except for the storyteller). The first player to reach 30 points on the board, wins. Once the round is over, The storyteller then becomes the person to the right.In my class, this game has really picked up steam and the students have learned to not be too obvious or to impossible in the sentences they create. I see they offer an expansion pack of images for this game. I will have to pick that up soon - this game is well worth the price and would be worth it for any classroom or family! [SEP]"",""[CLS] As soon as I read the description of Dixit and saw samples of the artwork I knew I'd like this game.  (Note: You can see up close photos of the board and many of the cards at boardgamegeek.)  My expectations were proven correct.  It's easily one of my favorites now that I've played it.As others have noted, Dixit is a little similar to Apples to Apples. Apples might appeal to a broader audience because it's more accessible and obvious.  But make no mistake, Dixit is far better.  Assuming you're familiar with the rules of both, here's why:1. Whereas Apples forces you to work within the confines of the words provided, Dixit asks you to come up with something, a word, a sound or sentence, that hints at the image.  This is what makes the game cerebral or emotional and most definitely creative. Dixit will work parts of your brain that don't always get used that often.2. Every player is more involved in the creative process. In Apples each player takes turn being the judge who then decides who wins the round.  In Dixit the player playing their card attempts to win points by coming up with an appropriate word, sound or phrase that gets some votes, but not all.  In each round every player is participating (they have to pick a card of their own to play, just like in Apples) and judging whereas in Apples once you've laid down your card it's all on the judge.3. Dixit allows people of all ages and abilities to participate and even win. I played this in a group of six ranging in ages from 13 to 74 and there was only about a six point spread between the lowest and highest scores. It's a game that rewards all kinds of creativity and knowledge, regardless of age. The reason Dixit works here and Apples doesn't goes back to #1.There are a couple of drawbacks. One, there is more downtime compared to Apples when a player is deciding what card to play and what to say about that card.  If the person doesn't have a creative bone in their body then this might bog down quite a bit.  Two, if you like this game you're going to go through the cards pretty fast. The cards can be used several times, make no mistake.  But I think after about 15 or so plays you'll want to move on and get Dixit 2. How many plays it works will depend on how often you play.  Since I loved the game I bought Dixit 2 without hesitation . . . I'm just crossing my fingers that they'll be a Dixit 3, 4, etc. [SEP]",[CLS] This is a&nbsp;Dixit Board Game. - 84 Image Cards - Scoreboard - 6 Wooden Rabbits - 36 Voting Tokens - Rules [SEP],https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51yfF3teKML.jpg

If you have a child that enjoys arts and crafts, put this at the top of your list.  All gift recipients (5 yr olds) have told me that it is their favorite thing to make.One thing that I must stress is follow the instructions EXACTLY! Preheat your cookie sheet in the oven. Use babypowder on the foil. Watch the shrink dinks shrink. Do not use a toaster oven; you will not get the best results.

My complaint is that this is called a deluxe set, but does not come with any special paper to make additional charms, etc.  Because the Incredible Shrinky Dinks Maker does come with sheets of paper, my granddaughter was able to make an additional charm of her own creativity and attach it to her bracelet.  (See Customer Image.)I would like to also point out that the items start out large and feel like paper, but after they shrink up, they become hard like plastic, and they are much smaller.  The loops for the charms are pretty weak and open easily, so you might want to use a pair of pliers to squeeze them tight together, or buy stronger loops.  Or, if you lose one of the charms like my granddaughter did, use that as an excuse to make a replacement charm!If you are buying this set and do not have the Shrinky Dinks Maker, you really should consider purchasing it.

Do you need more food, or do you want more workers, or do you need some cloth and stone? How many cities do you want to build? You can roll more dice when you have more cities, but you'll also have to generate more food to feed those cities. It's a fun balance of planning and luck.

Players take the roles of different civilizations during the Bronze Age.  Each turn a player rolls a number of dice equal to their cities (starting at three). These dice have different faces ranging from workers, food, goods, coins, and disasters. A player can reroll the first roll twice just like Yahtzee, but all disaster faces must be kept.  After a player finishes rolling, the player collects food, workers, and goods depending on the dice results.  The most confusing aspect of the game is you earn goods.  Each player has a peg board and a score sheet.  This peg board has spots for food and goods.  There are six different tracks for goods, but you gain goods by moving each peg one space starting at the bottom for every one good you have.  If you gain more than six goods in a turn, then the bottom good gains another rank and so on up.  As an example, if you gain seven goods, you would gain one rank of each good, then gain one extra rank in the bottom two goods.  After collection, players then feed their cities and have disasters happen.  Don't have enough food for your cities?  Then you gain disaster points at the bottom of your score sheet.  Some disasters give negative points at the end, cost the player goods, or even attack other players like the literal plague (rolling three disasters results in a plague that gives every other player three negative points.  Players can then spend workers to earn more cities or monuments for points by spending workers to cross of boxes.  When you cross off all the boxes in a city or all the boxes of a monument, you have built that monument or city and now get the points or dice in future turns.  The first player to build a monument gets a higher score of points, while the players who builds after get fewer points.  Players can also buy one development a turn.  These developments do several things like preventing plagues, allow you to save more resources, or get you extra points for monuments or cities.  To buy a development, a player spends coins from dice or goods.  Each good rank has a number associated with it indicating how much it's worth for developments.  You have to fully spend all your goods of one type if you use them-you do NOT get the difference!  Once a player is done, he/she passes the dice, and the next player takes their turn.  The game continues until someone has five developments or all the monuments have been built between all the players.  Then, the game continues until all players have taken an equal number of turns.  Player with the highest score wins.Mechanics-This game is quick, but has a surprising amount of depth.  You roll the dice three times, choosing which dice to keep, and then you make choices with the resources you find.  It's all pretty easy.  However, what you get and your own plan really make you think on your feet.  It's fast, but smart and elegant.  5/5Theme-I love Euro-style games, but these games really lack the theme and story of their American cousins.  There is a store here as you build different world wonders and have the make choices for your society.  Will you abuse your people to build great heights or will you stay small and manageable?  If you look for a story, it's here, but the instructions won't help you as you get a one sentence introduction to the games story.  You can tell that story isn't the focus of this game.  The components are nice and do feel a bit old, in a good way, so it's not a complete loss.  2/5Instructions-The instruction to this game are well done.  It's a simple game that runs quick, so the instructions are a tri-fold pamphlet.  The hardest part of the rules is understanding how goods work.  If you can get past that and the examples provided, you're golden.  These rules do a good job of getting you playing all by yourself without having to turn to Board Game Geek and the internet for help. 5/5Execution-Here is where this game shines way above most games.  This game doesn't just have some dice; it has custom carved wooden dice.  It doesn't just have markers for your items; it has cool wooden boards with different colored pegs for each item.  I was kind of disappointed the game didn't come with golf pencils to mark up your score sheet, but nobodies perfect. 4.9/5Summary- This is one of the games I bring with me to cons and game days whenever I travel.  It's light as it fits into a small box, it's heavy as its got some great Eurogame elements in a dice game, and it's quick as it takes less than half an hour to play.  You learn how to play in less than five minutes, and you start making smart choices in 10.  If this game had some pencils and a bit more theme to it, this game would be at the top of my dice game list.  However, given what's here, this game is a blast and something you shouldn't pass up. 85% [SEP]"",""[CLS] As noted in many of my other game reviews, I'm I am always looking for games I can play with my fiance. She is what some would call a reluctant gamer whereas I am an avid gamer, so I have be careful about what games I introduce her to. She prefers games that rely at least a little on luck (i.e., not all strategy) and aren't too complex (i.e., where you can learn/remember the mechanic after a game or two), whereas I love strategy and complexity but don't mind a little luck. We also like games you can finish in a single session (or games you can play multiple times in a single session). Recently got this game am happy to report that Roll Through the Ages had something for both of us.It's a dice game so there is a luck component (but you get rerolls which mitigates a good amount of the luck). Solid strategy component in deciding which dice rolls to keep, what cities, monuments, and developments to build, how much food to store, and more.  We were presently surprised by this one. Feels a little like&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Ra-The-Dice-Game/dp/B002JPRY80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Ra: The Dice Game</a>&nbsp;(which we also like quite a bit), but there are enough differences between the two that neither will replace the other. Plus, this one is still in print and easier to get. First game might take an hour, but after that games typically last about 30 minutes once you figure out the rules. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This game is awesome! Each session has a different feel to it. It's a fun game with 2 people  (can be played solo) but the element is the best with 3-4 people. With more people you have more to pay attention to from your opponents. Also it's an easy game to bring with on trips, easy to teach and replay over and over. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Roll Through the Ages: 2-4 Players, Ages 10+, Average Play Time = 30-45 MinutesThe components are few, meaning that setup and clean up is very quick.  The players boards and dice are made of wood, giving them a nice heft.  On the official website, you can download scoresheets and find rules for a variant that makes the game longer and a little more complex.  That variant is called, Roll Through the Ages: The Late Bronze Age.As I mentioned earlier, I am not a fan of dice games.  There is the possibility of rolling all skulls on your first roll, probabilities be damned.  People who absolutely hate luck based games may not take to this game fully.  What attracted me to the game were the developments, which help to offset bad dice rolls among other things.  One game mechanic that I always enjoy, in any game I play, is the ability to level up be it via technology, stats, whatever.  This game doesn't offer a huge list of developments, but it serves its purpose for the average play time that it allots.  Sometimes, I can't afford to sit down and spend hours leveling up from sticks and stones to nuclear missiles.Anthony (16) said that he liked the game and is a lot more fun if you have four players instead of two.  From the game that we played, he concentrated on rolling workers and completing monuments.  I, on the other hand, rolled a lot of coin and goods, so I was able to quickly buy some developments early on that served me well later in the game.  Anthony mentioned in passing that he'd play this game again.The bottom line?  It's not your average dice game and for that, I recommend it.  Potential buyers should still be aware that there is a luck factor involved, even if developments can offset bad rolls.  The game plays quickly and is simple enough to where kids can jump right in after a little coaching.  All in all, it's a fun little game to bring out on family game night.

Its very portable and can be played in a variety of settings, even at the beach or pool.  If that is what you are purchasing the game for, its almost perfect.  But if you are going to sit down at the table to play a game with 3 or more people, there are far better choices out there.  The big reason is the downtime between turns.  Many other games also have some downtime when it is not your turn, but there is still planning you can do and you still find yourself involved.  However, in Roll Through the Ages, there really isn't anything you can do until you see what you are going to roll.  And what other players do on their turn usually has little or no impact on you.  Hence, it is very easy to get bored in this game when it is not your turn.  With 2 players, the downtime is not that bad, but it can get excessive with 4 players especially in the later rounds when everyone is rolling 5 or more dice.

I was hoping for the same doll so when family members come over with younger daughters they wouldn't fight over this or that doll they would both look alike but it's ok they are both VERY cute and Im just happy i finally found a big doll that fit real clothes since baby doll clothes is so expensive and cheaply made and are only velcro so she really can't learn from velcro.

I like this version but I did print out the 1963 directions as suggested by other reviewers.  Not sure what the difference is but my kids had been playing with those rules so we stuck with them.  The only complaint I have is that I wish the little storage boxes were plastic instead of cardboard because we pull them out of the box while playing the game.  I taped them over with packing tape so they will last though and it was a perfect fix. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Risk is one of my favorite games of all time. Players start by using their armies to take possession of the many territories on the board which make up the continents North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Players then take turns using the dice to battle each other in an attempt to gain possession of each territory their opponents own. The game ends when a player has eliminated all of his opponents' armies and thus occupies all the territories in the world. The game can last many hours, especially when playing with 4, 5 or 6 players. There are different game variations if you don't want to play the traditional, and normally longer, game of World Domination, though in my personal opinion World Domination is the way to go.There is some strategy involved in Risk as you decide things like which territories to place your armies on, who to attack, and how much fighting you'll do on each turn. At the same time, there is also a lot of luck involved since you're always rolling the dice and are sometimes drawing a card from a deck that can give you an opportunity to place more armies on the board. Overall, Risk can be a very fun and unpredictable game. You never know who's going to roll high numbers, and it's not always clear what territories your opponents are going to try invading in their quest for world domination. I was introduced to this game back in high school when I spent the night at a friends house, and I fell in love with it. Even if I'm not playing well, I still enjoy watching the action unfold between my opponents, and listening to their reactions when something good or bad happens can be entertaining as well.There are so many things that make Risk a great game.

B001QIQXUQ,"[CLS] Great idea. I was expecting a little booklet inside showing how to do some of the characters but all that is included is what is on the cover of the tin.  Still was happy with the kit then I noticed they show all the stamps on the finger prints with black and that is not an included color.  My daughter and I spent 10 minutes playing and drawing and the included yellow is already too dry to make finger prints anymore.  I would have been better off getting the Ed Emberley's book and using my own ink pads, color pencils, etc...this was an impulse buy and not worth the price even on sale. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this for my son and he loves it.  Finger prints are inherently messy, but the ink pads in this set are small which seems to keep the mess a little more controlled and I also like the way the case holds all the little pieces together in a cute and neat package.  It would be nice if the inside of the tin included some more suggestions for thumb print designs because I think it is easier for young children to replicate what they see, but that would be my only suggestion.

I always try to have a few things in my bag for my son to do and this is small enough to take with us and allows for a lot of creativity to keep him busy.

For hours, she sat on the floor and played with the castle and its contents. I wish I had noticed that the castle came with dolls and furniture, but since I didn't, I ordered additional dolls and furniture. Oh, well, she loves it all. One feature I love about this toy is its portability...just fold and go. Being made out of wood, it's sturdy and because it's a Melissa & Doug product, you can count on it being well-made.

He hasn't yet played with it,as his birthday is not for one more week, but I have opened the box, and looked at all the peices and they are very well made.  I let my 7 yr old daughter play with it before I re wrapped it up, and she thought it was wonderful.  I love that it is so small, and portable. My son tends to like to play mostly in the living room, and I didn't want some giant thing that would be confined to his bedroom b/c of its size, and left unplayed with. If he really gets in to it , I would consider a larger one in the future, but I think for a four year old this is a perfect size, and price. Also, the larger castles don't tend to come with any people or furniture.  I liked that for such a low price, this castle comes with four people,2 horses, plus furntiture. The people, and horses alone I believe are sold seperately  for $ [...].  I also appreciate that this toy doesn't not make any sounds, and does not light up. It does have a drawbridge door that works, as well as a jail that has a door which goes up and down. I think this will encourage my son to use his imagination. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Loved it.

They immediately knew all the things that went together and spent over an hour playing with the castle. I thought the characters that came with the castle looked cheesy but my son LOVES them.  I might even buy the other set because he loves them so much.  Great price, I think the castle is beautiful! Yes the inside is plain but that leaves more to the imagination to me and no stickers to start peeling off and making it look junky.

It's darling, durable, & easy to put on a bookshelf after playtime is over.  The wooden people fit in the castle but not the furniture.  This doesn't matter to the girls.

I got it so she could give it as a gift with a tag that said she had one as a baby and loved it.I love that it is light enough for a baby to hold, has elastic bands(that are super secure)so the toy can be squished into a small space and when taken out it will 'spring' back to its normal shape.

The beads slide back and forth along the dowels when shaken, producing a very pleasing rattle and allowing baby to explore sound and learn cause and effect.

He indicated that with limited recess time, Blurt was perfect because set-up was a breeze (unlike say Monopoly or Life) and he was thrilled with all the yelling!  As a mom, I was happy I didn't have to spend time scouring the directions for loopholes as nobody was bickering over rules.  The game is pretty self-explanatory  -  a simple and fun concept for all ages. [SEP]"",""[CLS] One of my favorite word games!  My husband and I are teachers, so anything with words is interesting to us.  Kids like the blurting out of answers and the adults like the challenge of beating other adults to the answer.  It makes them feel smart and educated. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is the second time I've reviewed this game and nothing's changed.... I still love it.  We bought the newest set because we burned through all of the cards of the first game.  If you like party games and if you like shouting and laughing, this is the perfect game.The game is extremely simple.  It is a multi-player game, meaning 4 or more.  If you have many people, let's say 20, no problem, just break them into teams.  The last time we played we had five teams of three people.  Each team rotates being the reader while the other teams answer.  The reader reads a definition on the card and the first person/team to blurt out the right answer wins that round.In this game it pays to have a good vocabulary and to be LOUD!!  You may know every word in the dictionary but if no one can hear you give the answer then you will lose every time.  Now, of course there are the occasional arguments to determine who said the answer first, but it all boils down to who did the reader hear.We had so much fun with this game and we had ages 10 up to 65.  The definitions aren't incredibly hard, it is just the pressure to be the first to yell out the answer.  We love love love the game, only if they'd make refills!!! [SEP]","[CLS] Think fast. What word means a partially dried grape? Be the first player to say raisin, and you're on your way to winning this riotous game of rapid word recall. Players take turns reading clues aloud, competing to blurt the correct answer first and move ahead on the board. The first person or team to circle the board is the winner. Sounds simple, right? But as the race for the right word heats up and the blurting gets boisterous, it's easy to get tongue-tied. Blurt is a great vocabulary builder for the kids, a hilarious addition to adult parties, and a must for a family game night. For 3-12 players. Ages 10 and up. Includes a Junior version for ages 7-9.

B001QXDIX6,"[CLS] I did a little bit of research on little toddler kitchen sets before deciding on this one.  What I found in my research was that many of these kitchens are overpriced and/or PINK!  I have nothing against pink but I get sick of buying pink ALL the time for my little girl.  Plus, some kitchen sets are too wide and I needed something compact.When I saw this kitchen (and the price being much lower than others like it) I was suspicious.  There were no other reviews on it when I bought it so I took a chance and purchased it anyway.  I couldn't beat the price and I loved the colors (NO PINK).When we got it, it was very easy to put together.  I whipped it up within about 20 minutes.  The stickers for the microwave, oven, etc. are pretty cheesy and you have to be very careful to make sure they are CENTERED and that you can push the bubbles out otherwise once you stick them then there is no fixing them.My daughter loves this set.  She's 15 months and likes kitchen stuff.  She is always playing with this set including putting her real food on the counter.Overall it's a really great buy.  I would definitely buy it again, especially for the price and because it's a nice unisex color.  Sometimes I get tired of bright primary or loud pink colors for children's toys that it's refreshing when something isn't screaming juvenile.Great buy.  I think it may be a tad too small for a child over 3 or 3 1/2 but it's perfect for kids 18 months to just under 3.  Highly recommended! [SEP]"",""[CLS] The children enjoy playing with this, and it does come with a couple of items, but I needed to supplement with their food in order to make it worth using their imagination. Before purchasing their extras, the children kept asking, Where's the food? I think that Little Tikes should consider adding a few items extra to make it worth owning without attempting to bilk parents out of more money having to purchase their add-ons at a ridiculously high price.The item went together within a couple hours (doing it alone). The doors work, the noise of the water and stove intrigued the children, so that was a nice feature. The children tended to play with that more than anything prior to my buying the food. It appears to be well constructed, however, it did want to tip when one of the toddlers pulled on the towel rack in an attempt to climb it, so my husband had to bolt it to the wall. Keep this in mind when setting up. It isn't sturdy enough to be pulled on or it will topple. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Great little space-saving kitchen!

Seems a little over priced, but couldn't find anything cheaper.  My animal crazy granddaughter should love it for Christmas. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This puzzle was not purchased via Amazon as far as I know.  It was one of the many puzzles that are constantly being donated to our school.  This puzzle was received after it has been used by a family.  It has now gone through at least twenty sets of little hands and I have to tell you that it has held up quite well...in many ways it almost looks new.  And that is one of the hallmarks of the Ravensburger line of puzzles - they are extremely durable and hold up well under abuse.This particular item is extremely popular with the kids.  Children like animals; the more exotic the better and I have observed some of the children putting this one together over and over again.  The mat type surface is ideal as there is no glare.  This is very important when you have strong lighting and young ones with glasses.  The puzzle is constructed with heavy cardboard stock and the pieces have not become dog-eared with continual use.The picture quality on this one is quite good with excellent details.  There is very little extended mono-colored background which makes it ideal for the younger set.Puzzles are great for developing small motor skills, focus and concentration.  When they are used by more than one child at a time they help develop cooperation skills and reasoning skills.  It is fascinating to listen to them working on these things.Now once these Ravensburger puzzles are completed, I have found that running a very, very lightly moistened paper towel over them and quickly drying them with a completely dry paper towel cuts down on the damage done by sticky little fingers that are not always a clean as they should be.  This method of cleaning (VERY lightly moistened) seem to work fine and does not damage the puzzle.If you spend a few extra dollars, which you will with this brand of puzzle, you will find that in the long run you will actually save money as these things can last a long, long time.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks [SEP]","[CLS] Ravensburger has been making toys for the hand, head, and heart for over 130 years.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] Cute gag gift [SEP]"",""[CLS] I was introduced to this wonderfully stress relieving toy by another satisfied owner who has had it for years.  She loaned it to me at a time of great stress and it came in very handy, truly relieving anxiety and stress.  I liked Panic Pete so much that I bought one of my own.  That purchase, however, yielded a Pete whose nose did not function properly.  I didn't return it because it just wasn't worth the trouble.  I had a few extra dollars and purchased a second Panic Pete and this one came through in perfect condition, with nose, eyes, and ears all bulging out when Pete was squeezed.  He's a favorite around my house for relieving stress and anxiety.  I liked it so much that I wanted to purchase one for my students.  I'm a special education teacher in a girls' high school and many of the students have anxiety issues along with learning disabilities and other emotional issues.  I accidentally got onto the page with Bug Out Bob, who looks the same, but is built slightly differently and doesn't work as well as Panic Pete.  My students still love him and use him frequently to relieve their stress, to stop biting fingernails, etc.  The amazing thing is that it doesn't distract them and some of them have ADHD!  I would definitely stick with Panic Pete by Schylling because the effect is so much better.  It's a great toy and stress reliever.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] Cute and super fun! [SEP]"",""[CLS] It's ok. The worms don't move. Kids thought it was cute and have fun playing in it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We found out AFTER purchasing this that our son hates water being sprinkled on him and he wouldn't go near it. But my husband jumped through it and we're hoping next year he won't mind so much or that his little brother will enjoy it more. It's a really cute product and works well. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This sprinkler is perfect for your child (and let it be known it IS intended for children, so don't come home from work and dance around in it- you'll get funny looks by your neighbors and even your other family members, believe me).  A big issue however is that you're actually wasting a lot of water by using this sprinkler.  Maybe not a *lot* but more than you should ever be wasting.  If water's not used for an important reason, yeah, you're wasting it. Maybe put a limit on how much your child uses it and keep an eye on him/her to make sure they don't spend all day dancing around in water. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We ordered this product for my 16 month old son as an outdoor water toy.  We've used this several times now and have been very happy with what it....He really enjoys playing in it and we have been very happy with its durability. It does have a constant flow from the water source, so there is no variation in the height of the water spray (unless you adjust the water pressure at the source).  While this may be an issue with older children, it wasn't an issue for my son.  I actually saw it as a positive because the water level didn't change suddenly and surprise/scare him.  The individual 'grubs' are made out of a rubbery, plastic material and are very durable. My son has already bent, yanked, stepped on, etc. them and they haven't come loose and bounce right back up.  I will say that the connector piece is very durable. We have had other sprinklers with cheaper connector pieces, so when you connect to the hose there is a lot of spray that is lost where the hose connects to the sprinkler. This is not an issue with this toy and it is easy to connect/disconnect. Overall this is a good sprinkler toy and will be very durable for use for several summers.

I hadn't played in years but a friend of mine turned me back on to it and I didn't wait to purchase my own copy. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Scattegories is a unique and entertaining game that challenges you to think quickly and make smart decisions. In each round, players are given a letter and 12 different categories. You have a have a certain amount of time to write down a response for each category, and it must begin with that particular letter. The categories include things like the name of a country or the name of an actress or an item in the kitchen. You get 1 point for each appropriate response that you wrote down, but if someone else wrote the same response then neither player receives a point for that category. If a player disagrees with one of your responses, then you have to explain your reasoning for writing that down. The players will then vote on whether or not to accept that response (this can lead to some entertaining debates between opponents). The player with the most points after a certain number of rounds is the winner.Scattegories has been one of my favorite games for many years. It can be interesting to hear what responses your opponents wrote down for the various categories. Some can be real funny, some can be kind of strange, and some can be so simple you'll be upset at yourself for not thinking of it. The pressure can really get to you though as you listen to that loud and persistent timer tick away knowing that you only have a couple minutes to come up with a response different than your opponents for 12 different categories and each one has to begin with the same letter. You don't just need brains to win; you also need to handle the pressure effectively. This is one of those games that everyone can enjoy, even if they don't play that well.

B001RNJ8WK,"[CLS] Certainly one of my favorite games, special in my heart as it was the last game my daughter purchase prior to her passing. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Has been a great game for many years. Purchased as a birthday gift for my four year old son. We love to play! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I will echo what everyone else is saying, yes, yes, 100 times yes - this game is a crappy copy of a beloved childhood favorite.  I actually bought mine a few years ago so the board is red but it is the same horrible design - with the additional insult that the box reads same great playing game!  easy storage box.It is NOT the same great playing game and there is nothing easy whatsoever about removing the hippos, extending the necks, puzzling them in place, and getting the thin flimsy lid shut compared to putting a ONE PIECE board back in a simple, sturdy box.  I guess they realized how false this claim and removed it - which means they know how lousy the game is yet they continue to produce it.Seriously how much more money could it cost to make this the old way?  People would gladly pay a few dollars more for a game their kids get use out of.  This game works just well enough that every buyer is hopeful it will work out for their kids, but Hasbro should really be ashamed of this toy.  Junky toys that don't work as they should are no fun for anyone. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We bought this toy, not from Amazon, but from another store and it's just HORRIBLE.  My daughter can barely push down the lever to open the hippo's mouth.  Most of the time the mouth doesn't even open.  Or, the neck part will get stuck out.  I paid a little more than what it's advertised on amazon and I definitely wouldn't pay more than five bucks for this thing.  We bought it thinking it would be a fun little game for my husband, daughter and I too play on a relaxing family night, but NO.  Definitely NOT.  FYI: I LOVE amazon! [SEP]"",""[CLS] First off, you are not able to store the assembled game in the box - so if you want to store it neatly, you have to disassemble it.  And let me tell you, it's kind of a pain to disassemble and reassemble, especially if your child loves playing it often.The game itself is not of great quality.  It is cheaply made and flimsy.  Often the hippos' levers get stuck in the down position, necessitating pausing the game in order to dislodge the lever.The marbles get lost easily - would be great if they would include a few extra to replace the lost ones.  Also would be great if they provided a zip-top bag to store them in.I didn't have this game growing up, but coveted it.  We bought it for our daughter excitedly, and were completely disappointed.  I will be stashing it away with the hope that my daughter will forget about it.The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one, is because my daughter enjoys playing the game. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My and my boys 3 & 4 got two days of play out of this game! Here is our rating low downThe Good:* Ummmmmm.... thinking.... still thinking.... oh yeah, a classic game that would be a blast if not for the cheap construction and parts used now days.The Cons:* Cheap thin plastic!* The hippos get stuck with their mouths open* The balls are cheap weightless plastic balls. That with some speed will totally fly off the board.* The board once put together will not fit back into the box... so you have to store it as is and find a way to store the balls without loosing them. We taped a ziplock to the board with all the balls in it for storing them.* The board itself is alot smaller than the original, easy to butt heads trying to play it now.. and I mean the kids butting heads while leaning in to see where the balls are rolling too. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Like so many other reviewers, I have fond memories of playing this as a child and was excited when my 3 1/2 year old asked for it for Christmas.  And like so many other reviewers I am HUGELY disappointed with the changes that have been made to this game's construction.It truly is made of the cheapest plastic and the hippos heads/necks get stuck frequently which is extremely frustrating for the kids and adults alike.  But worst of all once the game is assembled it DOESN'T FIT INTO THE BOX!!!  Who sells a board game that can't be stored in the box in which it comes??  Ridiculous! Of course the box does suggest that you disassemble the hippos from the game board in order to store it, however I have been unable to get them back out and am afraid to force them since the plastic is so flimsy I am sure it will break.If I had read the reviews before purchasing this game I would have talked my daughter into asking for something else.  It's a real shame because the original version that I had from the 1970's was so sturdy that my family passed it down over the years and was still playing with it up until just a few years ago.  I'll be surprised if thi game lasts more than 1 year. I guess it is just another sad example of how we have lowered our standards and expectations over the years.  So sad. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 5 year old niece just received this for her birthday.  It was opened for the kids to play while we were there and I was appalled at how cheap this game was made.plastic marbles, er, I mean balls really?????It is not one continious baord like the old origional but you slide the hippos into place.  Which makes them flimsy while trying to play the game, becuase they will shift and make the board uneven.I can even tell it is much smaller than the origional, and the hippos had a tendency to get stuck while extended out with thier mouths open.  And this was all noticeable the first time we took it out of the box.shame shame.... [SEP]","[CLS] Down by the river in a shady grove, live the Hungry Hungry Hippos.

B001RU7UNW,"[CLS] Bang! is a win-by-elimination card game that supports up to seven players, in which it is possible for a player to be eliminated within the first couple of rounds while the rest of the game can take over 30 minutes to finish.  Even though it doesn't happen that often, and when it does it's primarily due to luck of the draw and other players smelling blood in the water, this is a terrible design.  The dice version of this game is much better. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is such a fun and simple game. Honestly though it says you can play with 4 people I recommend 6 people to play. It is much more fun that way because you really don't know who is who except for the sheriff. We've loved adding this to our game nights! It's also a great starter game as well simply because it can go so quickly. We generally like to start game nights with a few shorter games before moving on to longer games like Smash or Small World. This is also a great introductory game for people who don't generally play board games. It's has easy enough to follow rules and a lot of replayability. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is not my favorite game. There's just so many different cards doing so many different things written in two languages. It makes the cards look crammed and hard to follow. That being said, my 11 year old loves the game, and he even saved up his money to buy the expansion for it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is one of my favorite hidden role games because there's so much interaction with the other players.  Games like The Resistance don't do anything for me because you don't interact with the other players besides the normal mind and word games to figure out who they are.  Bang! still has all that and so much more.  You can still interrogate and try to get the other players to slip up and reveal who they are while at the same time playing a Western-themed card game.  I've played it so much I've lost a little love for it, but it is still an incredibly well-designed, fun, and exciting game and one of the best games with hidden role mechanics that I've played.  I will concede it can be really crappy when the odds are against a player and they find themselves eliminated quickly and watching the game finish from the sidelines though. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I love spaghetti westerns, but I don't like this game. I've played Bang about a dozen times over the years (when forced to by my gaming group). There's a lot of annoying take that! mechanics that I despise and the whole game is about screwing people over with gunplay and random wild west craziness. The worst part is you can die super-fast and be out of the game early, sitting around bored while the other players play on for another hour or so. How is that fun? It isn't, at least not to me.

Without all those cards (including ways to block hits), the game plays much faster and with less confusion. If you get killed early, you'll only be sitting around maybe twenty minutes with nothing to do, as opposed to the hour or more with the annoying card game version. The art is much nicer in the dice game too. That said, I still don't really like it, but would rate the dice game a full star higher than the original (three stars).

B001SN8DE8,"[CLS] This is a wonderful product. I bought mine years ago and works great. One review here speaks of short cords now but mine is older and the cords are plenty long to group around a table and then some. This unit requires no batteries (although you can choose to put them in the main unit if you are using it outside or something) as it has an AC adapter which is what I use. The buzzers work very well. Only six can play at once. I teach 5th and 6th graders at church and they love this but sometimes they just want to push the buzzers and be silly without having an answer. So, when they answer incorrectly, their turn at the buzzer is done and the next child comes up to play and so forth. This works great and discourages silly 'button pushing'. When I have extra kids, I also often give the kids a turn being the question answer person with the white button to clear the buzzers after each guess. I found that it took too long to try and think up questions and/or look appropriate ones up in a trivia book to play this game being I wasn't working off a review in a textbook or something like that. So, I found the game Outburst. They make a Bible version I use at church as well as a kid and Junior version that each have their own trivia cards. The cards slip in a reader that decodes the answers. So, I don't use the board to that game, just the cards and reader so it is very compact to keep with this Eggsbert unit. The cards have a subject like Name animals listed as being on Noah's ark. Then, the card lists 10 answers to guess with check marks on the reader just off to the side of each answer. This way you can easily keep track of the answers already given until all 10 are answered. The Jr and kid version of Outburst has fun questions like name the Disney movie villains etc. I find that if I alternate a general question like this with a Bible one, it keeps the kids interest well. We then have a jar of crayons on the table and a bag of candy. For each correct answer, a child takes a crayon and then when they have a certain amount of crayons, they trade them in to choose a piece of candy. I have brought this game to school as well as church. I have played it with 1st graders up to Junior Highers. They all love it and so do the adults who see it. Everyone wants to know where it came from. Very fun way to learn! I can't say a bad thing about it. If it broke today, I would quickly replace it with the very same thing. If you are a teacher at school or church, you will not regret the purchase. It is well worth the money. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I've used this multiple times,and I have even lent it out to others to use it. It's great. I've heard it is better than the wireless one, but I've never tried the wireless one. This was a very low price when I bought it, so I was pleasantly pleased with my purchase. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Works great as a way to buzz in for any type of quiz or game show that you are trying to do. I do wish it came with more than six, but if you have six or less people/teams, this is great [SEP]"",""[CLS] I am a speech pathologist in the school system, working at two different schools. This game is a great game to easily transport from school to school. I like to use it for speech jeopardy in which children race to be the fastest to answer language questions.The students love it!There are 2 functions. In one function, you play the game like jeopardy with the white button being used to reset each round. In the 2nd function, when the white button is pressed, a light races through all the colors and randomly ends at one player's color. You can set a timer so children have to answer within 5, 10, etc. seconds. [SEP]"",""[CLS] When it was on sale for $15. I bought two, one for us to keep at home and one for my 1st grader's teacher. Her teacher was SUPER excited to receive it and said she always wanted one of her own. She has been teaching 1st grade for over 30 yrs, so I figured she'd already know what it was. I haven't used the one I kept for ourselves yet, but figured it could be used for a trivia game when we have people over or if my daughter has a play-date, I might try some simple question games with the kids. No - it does not come with an A/C adapter but I'm hoping I have a compatible one somewhere in the house. For now I will use batteries (four AA's).To summarize: Makes a GREAT gift for your child's teacher! [SEP]",[CLS]  [SEP],https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51O38EUcjDL.jpg

This one little riff gets old quick.  Also, this puzzle more than the others is possessed if you don't have all the pieces perfectly fitted in their hole.

B001TEUM2W,"[CLS] These beads are fantastic quality, they are smooth, the paint is even and flawlessly applied and the colors and shapes are every bit as appealing as they look in photos - perhaps more so! They were larger than I had expected, despite knowing the measurements in advance. I was unsure when ordering if, despite the age recommendation (18 months+), these would actually be appropriate for a younger child. (They are right on the border, measurement-wise of being a choking hazard). However, being able to hold them and look at them more closely, they are really quite large, and intuitively seem safe that way.In terms of the painted surface, I feel much safer with Holgate than I do with 99.9% of the toys out there these days. Holgate is a US company, and has been around forever. They have been making wooden toys for nearly a century. All of their wood, paints - everything - is US-sourced.Bottom line - this is a Made in the USA toy, at a truly reasonable price, absolutely fantastic quality - and a classic skill-building tool that will be fun for toddlers and preschoolers alike. I would definitely put this in my top-ten must-have toys list. It's just that cool. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We got this as a phase one toy to work on our son teaching the skill of bead stringing.  He has significant fine motor impairments, and we needed a large size bead that would be easy for him to grasp, and I was also a big fan of the fact that these were big enough that when he tried to eat them, and I knew he certainly would, that he couldn't get them swallowed.This has become one of the few toys he really loves, we've had it for a couple of years now, the paint is still on these beads, and even though we've been able to move him down to smaller beads from the skills perspective, he still loves this toy so much he's willing to sit for it, and he won't sit for many things.

He also enjoys throwing the beads, but we are working on that.I love that this toy is made in the USA by an established company.  If you are looking for other made-in-USA toys, we also have the Uncle Goose Wooden Alphabet Blocks which are great, and the Camden Rose Beautiful Hearth Kitchen.  Both of these toys are made in Michigan. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This bead set is really nice. I like how thick the cord is, makes it easy for little hands to thread the beads. We tied a knot at one end so he could easily string them all on while walking around.All of my beads came varnished and painted a variety of fun colors, there is one bead a little harder for little hands to thread because it is smaller, but I'm OK with that as it teaches variety and helps with dexterity. In regards to a complaint by one reviewer about the cord unraveling.... This is a woven nylon cord and it could easily be fixed by melting the end (hold it over a flame, when nylon starts to melt roll the end to create a nice threading end).This was easily one of our more popular toys this Christmas (can't decide whether the sewing/lacing boards trumped this bead set). It is great for imaginative play, finger dexterity, teaching life skills, and getting kids interested I sewing as my son refers to it. The quality of this set is wonderful and I really appreciate the jumbo size of these beads as it will make it easier for me to keep track of them.

B001TK3LOC,"[CLS] ROTF Bumblebee is another good one in the deluxe line! Bumblebee has a slight mold variation from the first movie series. The chest piece sticks out more instead of being more flat to the chest. The torso piece has less decor as well. The big difference is Bumblebee has one regular hand and his trusty pulse cannon blaster on the other arm which does come with a firing projectile. I personally think having two hands look better,but the pulse cannon on one does give it somewhat more realism to the movie for battle scenes. The head piece is more realistic to Bumblebee in the movie,but again I think the head piece on the first versions was alot cooler looking. Overall Bumblebee has great articulation in the legs,arms,body,and head piece in robot mode while having awesome detail in the camaro mode. The poseability is outstanding with great stability for creating battle scenes or displaying where you please. The durability is excellent as well with secure joints and a solid build in either mode. The transformation level is intermediate meaning if you have plenty of experience with transformers there is a mid-level difficulty. If you are a parent buying for a child of 5-6 or younger you might have to help some in the process. Bumblebee does have a very versatile transformation for all ages. To start off rotate the feet up against the leg while the front piece of the rear wheel rim rotates down to connect with the back section piece of the camaro. The headlight sections on the chest rotate down so there is one solid piece. The arms then rotate around so the hand is palm side up. The door panels will rotate outwards as well. The chest piece then rotates up and over the head piece. The front windshield piece rotates up  as the front wheels rotate around so the doors are behind the wheels. The tricky part is positioning the arms right in the interior of the camaro. The arms will be in an L-shape with the hand being palm up and the bigger part of the pulse cannon piece being torwards the inside next to the hand. A little part of the pulse cannon will be under the rear windshield. The front wheels slide in as the roof section connects with the body of the camaro. The doors close and Bumblebee is ready to roll out! The missile can be stored in the pulse cannon in camaro mode as well. Bumblebee is a great addition for any transformer fan.

Bumblebee Rocks and Transformers Rule!!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] This transformer is pretty bad yes but I have found use for it!  The plastic may be cheap, the arm cannon may be obnoxious and in the way of a decent transformation but the head mold is very nice.

Switch the heads of your 2007 movie bumblebee and your 2009 version and you're made in the shade!  Then take the rest and feed it TO THE HOUNDS!!!  or whatever it is the kids are feeding refuse to these days...

(seriously, it was like two pathetic toys in one!)I dunno, i really like this transformer, either as a collectors' item (hey, he looks pretty cool in the package) or as a toy (hey, he runs, guns, and transforms rather smoothly)I will grant you that there are a WHOLE lot of little panels and pieces to this guy, which is probably due to how awesome he looks as a robot (and how screen accurate)On the plus side, there is a lot of automorph to this guy, rotating his chest (the car hood) up rotates his arms and his windshield (its on his back) and sliding his feet up into position automaticly positions his rear fender and back window.I will also grant you that perhaps some of him is rather flimsy (his back window splits in two for goodness sakes) and some of the pieces can be tricky to fit in (doors?)Still, i think his camaro looks fantastic, and that his transformation, while difficult at first, is relatively easy since its basicly as follows:slide foot flush with shin (repeat on other foot)slide up hood over headplace hands behing his back (like he's been arrested for speeding) and snap the roof halves into placeslide in the doors and lockOH and snap his feet togethertheredonethat was easy (easy button anyone?)in fact the only real difficulty I've had with this guy is getting his doors to line up, but to be honest? transforming him back and forth is easy once you know how to do it, and if u know where everything goes on a car (you drivers should really) its pretty intuitiveTo finish, he's an outstanding mold and a fantastic camaro (camero? I can never remember how to spell it...) His tranformation can be a little tricky at first, but you really should be able to get the hang of it after two or three transformationsno longer is it simply break apart all the kibble to reveal the robot inside which I think is why everyone seems to be griping(side note, when even my five year old brother can figure it out with the instructions, you know its not that hard...)all in all worth the ten bucks or so you'll spend on it at target or toys R us or wherever [SEP]"",""[CLS] I passed this guy up my first few trips to the store in favor of better figures (leader Prime and Megatron).  He didn't look all that great in the package.  I finally picked him up with Deluxe Skids, and even then, didn't bother with him until after I messed around with Skids for a while, who is also cool.  Once you actually start messing around with the toy, you can see the charm it has, much like the actual Bumblebee character.  The head sculpt is dead on.  The detail in robot and car mode is very nice.  It's a well articulated figure, and can stand and be posed fairly well.  Turning him into car mode takes a little finesse to get complete, but it's not a complex transformation like Prime.  Yes, pieces pop off, but like some of the more observent reviewers have pointed out, they are meant to do that so the brand new toy isn't permenently broke.  They go back easily, and stay on.  The gun arm is MENT to come off in car mode.  A very cool and fun figure.

B001TK3LTW,"[CLS] His name is Optimus Prime!  He's the leader of the Autobots and an all around awesome guy.  This is Optimus' leader class Revenge of the Fallen figure and it's pretty sweet.For Kids:He's a 13 inch tall giant robot with lights and sounds and swords that pop out.  What's not to love?  And he can turn into a big rig.  Again, what's not to love?  Well there is the matter of the transformation. I don't think anyone under their teenage years will enjoy that part much.  And it's pretty tough for an adult too.For Adults:The biggest draw of this figure is that it looks very much like the actual movie version of Optimus.  If you're familiar with the last movie's toy line you know that while that leader class Prime was a fine toy it really didn't match up to it's movie counterpart well being fat, blocky and clunky.  That's not the case here.  This guy is lean and mean and really looks like Prime off the screen.In robot mode he's very poseable and has a few features.  Pressing down on a button on his front (or just tilting his head back) will cause his chest to lift (like he's standing up straight and proud) and light up and he'll say, My name is Optimus Prime! He sounds so awesome I wish he had more lines but that's it.  He also has energy swords that fold back and swing out at the push of a button on each forearm.  They do get in the way of his arm articulation when folded back.During transformation he makes a transformation sound but only once about mid way through when a certain part is snapped apart or together. Once in truck mode he has a button in back that causes an idling engine sound for a few seconds if pressed or continuous if held down.  His tires are plastic and not rubber but that's no big deal as they are well done.  His back wheels are on hinges and tend to flip up though.  Still he looks great in truck mode too.The big thing here is the transformation.  It's difficult!  Don't get me wrong, it's like any transformation in that you'll get used to it after a while but those first few times are a killer and can take half an hour or more.  More than any other transformer I've ever dealt with (including the other leader class Optimus) he has to have things slotted and tabbed in just so - there are tons of little tabs and slots and many delicate parts.  There's one point in the transformation where its clear what you need to do but it really looks like you'll break the toy - very nerve wracking as he isn't cheap (I watched a video of someone else doing it to get my nerve up).  It's a cool transformation and way different than the last movie Prime and like most transformers once he's in vehicle mode he's solid and looks great.  I do see lots of potential for breakage though so would not recommend for impatient kids... or adults.  Also of note is that those energy swords tend to pop out and get in the way when least expected.All in all he's pretty awesome with only minor annoyances (energy swords and flipping wheels) and he looks great.  Just be ready to spend some time transforming him those first few times.  Not for the impatient. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The Grand kids just love this. They play with it all of the time Would definately reccomend to other buyers [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this from Costco, not amazon, since it was a slightly better price. I always wanted, but never got, Optimus when I was a kid. Although I'm now in my 30s, I figured better late than never! :) Unfortunately, this take quite a bit of patience and a steep learning curve to transform. The plastic pieces feel like they're about to snap; what's worse, it takes quite a bit of pressure to get the various transformations to stick. I'm shocked I haven't snapped it into pieces yet! And yet... once transformed into truck or bot, it's quite an impressive model. So I'm keeping it, despite my better judgment. I definitely won't let my kids play with it, though! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I will start this review off by saying Optimus Prime is KICK-ASS!The ROTF version is a more sleek,not as bulky version than the first movie. I do love the first movie version,but also love this version just as much. The detail is awesome on this figure. The ROTF version does come with the sword feature,which was missing from the first version. The swords do store easily under his arms in robot or truck mode. Optimus is very sturdy&poseable for playing out battle scenes or just having him displayed somewhere. The durability is very excellent on Optimus. The transformation could be a little difficult for a child of 5 or younger. I myself had no problem transforming Optimus back&forth,but I have been collecting transformers for a while. Overall Optimus is a very well made,durable,highly detailed,awesome figure. I highly recommend this figure to any transformer fan looking for a sweet Optimus Prime figure. Transformers Rule!!!!!!!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] This leader class Optimus Prime is without a doubt one of the best Primes you will find on the market today.  He has two fantastic modes and is so accurate to the CGI design it's kind of scary.In vehicle mode you get the standard Peter built truck that the live action films have been using for Prime.  It is a solid vehicle and although it has plastic tires instead of the rubber ones from the '07 version, he still makes a better truck.  This has mostly to do with weapon storage.  The first leader class Prime had his ion blaster or sword stowed on the back of the truck making it rather obvious that this truck is packing some firepower.  However, the 2009 version keeps his flip-out swords stashed safely in his engine making sure that no one sees the robot in disguise!Now for the transformation, I'm not going to lie, it is difficult.  ATTENTION PARENTS:  IF YOU OR YOUR CHILD ARE NOT EXPERIENCED TRANSFORMER COLLECTORS BE ADVISED THAT THIS TRANSFORMATION MAY BE MORE THAN YOU CAN HANDLE!!!  KEEP THE INSTRUCTIONS HANDY AND WATCH SOME REVIEWS ON YOUTUBE FOR DETAILED TRANSFORMATION GUIDELINES!!!!  Even though the transformation is hard you have to work through it and you will have a great transformer.  Practice the transformation and get to know what this guy can handle to minimize risk of breakage.After the transformation your hard work pays off big time in a spectacular robot mode.  This robot is almost a PERFECT representation of the CGI autobot leader!  You may find yourself wondering just how someone could fit this massive bot into that Peter built truck from before.  He features some spectacular articulation, double energy swords and Peter Cullins voice telling every decepticon on the field just whom they are dealing with! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I am an Autbot girl, through and through. Love the Autobots, particularly, Optimus and Bumblebee. I saw the reviews on this, and since I couldn't find it in stores, decided to take a chance to get it online. Since I have Optimus in truck form, I knew that I would never transform this buddy. Thank goodness, because it was hard enough to get him upright in Autobot robot mode! Phew! But he's wonderful! He says one thing: I am Optimus Prime. But it's Peter Cullen's voice, so that's enough for me. His chest lights up, as well as his eyes. And you can see his actual gears in his chest. Not to mention the detail is good, especially for an actual figure. I follwed the pictures online (thank you for the customer who posted the pictures, thank GOD). And now he's going to join the other Autobots on my Entertainment Center lol. Not to be touched, of course. I collect these buddies, love 'em. My suggestion? This is for people who wish to collect this only, not as a toy. Because you will be frustrated to boot, and your kid will want to throw poor Optimus out the window. Poor Opty-chan :-(. [SEP]"",""[CLS] First thing I want to mention is the posted age limit of 5 years for this toy. This figure is tricky to transform, and a lot of kids would probably have trouble with it. 5 may be too you, maybe somewhere around 9 or 10? For younger kids who want a movie Optimus Prime figure, I would recommend the smaller, less expensive Voyager class figure... although not as impressive, he is simpler to transform. Or maybe the CyberStompin' Optimus?But back to Leader class Optimus Prime.I own several Prime figures, including the first release of the Masterpiece Optimus Prime... and even that figure is easier for me to transform than this guy. But still, this figure is one impressive transformer. He looks good in both modes.As a robot, he does an amazing job of capturing the likeness of his on screen counterpart, more so than any other figure, with probable the exception of the Robot Replicas line.He has a good range of movement (arms, legs, feet, knees ankles and wrists), but does lack a turning waist... oh well. A very minor flaw.But again... he just looks amazing! I look at this guy, and I still am surprised that he can transform into a semi truck as many of his truck pieces as so well hidden. Although he does suffer from a good amount of kibble on his back, but it's not horrible.As a robot, he has two gimmicks: first, you lower this tab near his waist and press it down. It causes his chest to move up, the gears inside of it to move a bit, his lights light up (including eyes), and you can hear a recording of him saying I am Optimus Prime (possible Peter Cullen himself doing the voice?).Second, he has his two extending battle blades from the film on each arm. There are buttons on the inside of each arm that when flipped, release the blades. The gimmick is neat, but flawed: the blades are so large that they are visible when retracted, and interfere with movement of the arms. They also are a major hindrance when transforming him. It would also be nice if his fists retracted too, but no luck on that. Still cool, but the blades are the only major thing they had been able to rework for this figure.Transformation is quite a process. And as I said, it is tricky. Parts often have a tenancy to interfere with the this piece or that fitting where they should.There are a few small cheats, like a few smaller pieces of his chest that look like truck parts folding up and not being truck parts at all. But the trick is keeping everything together and moving the parts in the right order. Don't be surprised if ball jointed parts snap off: they'll snap back on. But it's a pain.The aforementioned arm blades will almost certainly want to spring open.This may be the most complex transformer I have even handled.Another gimmick though: when you either pop apart his waist, or put it back together, he makes the classic transforming sound.Finally, when you get him to truck mode, you can appreciate how everything fits together so well. This complicated robot somehow becomes this truck. The truck doesn't look bad at all. You really don't see much robot kibble at all. If any, just a tiny bit on the very back of the truck where a trailer would connect. Even the back of the cab has no robot parts showing. And that brings me to the final sound gimmick. There is a small button on the back of the truck cab (easy to overlook, and it's not pointed out in the instructions) that makes motor sounds.Overall, an outstanding figure. Pretty complex, so be warned about that. Other than that and a few small issues, I recommend him. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I just bought this today. At first I wasn't going to because I have the Optimus Prime from the first movie, but the level of detail in this figure sold me. This one is very movie accurate in robot and vehicle mode both. The attention to detail on this figure is is extremely intracate. They did take away the ablitity to move the fingers though.I gave Durability a 4 because some of the parts come off during transformation, but they due snap bacl on very easily.Here is the reason I gave Fun a 4: Do not get this toy for a very young child though. I gaurantee that the child would have no fun with this toy. The direction are absolutely horrendous. This was one thing that Hasbro did not improve on. It took me a few hours to figure out how to transform Optimus from robot to vehicle mode.Overall though, a great figure for those like me who are collecting figures from the movie. I would also recommend the other figure as well. I have also bought most of those from ROTF. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This hands down the best Transformers toy I have ever bought.  I am very picky with the figures I buy being an accurate representation of the character they are based on.  I didn't by the first movie Prime because of this, it was a box that transformed into a truck.  I was blown away when I saw the ROTF figure.  Almost every detail they could possibly match with the CGI character is there.  The toy has incredible articulation.  It has Peter Cullen's voice.  It makes the well known G1 transformation sound.  Dual pop out swords.  Now, the first few times you try to transform this guy is going to be incredibly frustrating.  I looked up a video for help since the packaged instructions don't help much.  It gets alot easier after that.  Not a toy for children, unfortunatly; it is just too complex, and they will come to you every ten mintues asking you to transform it.  Rubber tires would have been cool, but doesn't take away from the figure.  It is painfully obvious alot of time and effort went into the design and [SEP]","[CLS] With the destruction of MEGATRON, OPTIMUS PRIME thought that he was finally, after millions of years, at peace. Little did he know that the escape of STARSCREAM would draw dozens of new DECEPTICONS to Earth. The desire that burns brightest in his Spark is that the war will soon end. He is determined to see that end come, and so he works with his human comrades and the other AUTOBOTS to hunt the DECEPTICONS that have come to Earth, and destroy them, one by one.

B001TM5X28,"[CLS] For a while now many movie toys have lacked a key component of what makes  transformers so special.  This is play value.  It is a simple concept that makes a person just plain enjoy his/her transforming robots.  Jetfire has this in spades!  In either mode he is very nice as an SR-71 Blackbird or as an angry old man with a Gatling gun on his arm.  This figure exudes pure fun.  Then there is the combined mode.  Wow.  If you have this guy do yourself a favor and pick up leader Prime.  I 100% guarantee that you will become a Jetfire fan overnight when you see the towering figure that is the combined Optimus+Jetfire Super mode!!!!  The toy is just so versatile that you really should stop reading this review and pick one up for yourself! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Jetfire is a grizzled old man of a transformer so how does he stack up as an action figure?For Kids:I can't see how any kid who's into Transformers at all would not like this guy.  He's huge, both in robot and in vehicle modes and has lights and sounds.  In combined mode with Optimus Prime he's an awesome battle bot of crazy proportions.  What's not to like?  Well, his transformation is not easy and the combining takes some skill as well so I would not recommend breaking a kid in on this guy.  Additionally the panels that make up his vehicle form are thin and have small tabs all over them that could break with an impatient child.For Adults:In robot mode as he comes out of the box he's quite impressive.  He's not really any taller than Leader Class Optimus but seems bigger due to the bulk on his back.  It adds a heft to him.  While he's heavy he's not overbalanced with it like Human Alliance Sideswipe (<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Transformers-Movie-2-Human-Alliance-Sideswipe-w-Sergeant-Epps/dp/B0023RKO1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Transformers Movie 2 Human Alliance - Sideswipe w/ Sergeant Epps</a>) and the way it's all hooked to his back looks regal on him as opposed to silly.  His arms and legs are well articulated but there's not much you can do with his head.  Push the button down on his chest and gears in his chest move, his head and chest light up and he says his name in a neat Irish accent.Changing him to the SR-71 Blackbird is a challenge to say the least and it will take several times to become proficient at it.  His main body simply unfolds but the panels of the plane are the difficult part.  They click and tab together very delicately.  A few of them are designed to pop off instead of break - which is good - but it can get annoying about the 5th time the same panel pops off while you're trying to finish up.  Once changed he's as solid as he should be though, assuming you clicked everything into place correctly.From the top this guy is a picture perfect SR-71 and looks just plain awesome.  Take her up to 75,000 feet at Mach 3 baby!  In this form you can press a button near the back of the plane to make a swooshing noise.  The only problem is that from the sides and bottom you see that the robot is, for an intents and purposes, just hanging there on the bottom of the plane.  I know there was probably no way to do it but it would have been cool to somehow hide some of those parts (like his arms) inside the plane.His third mode is to combine with Leader Class Optimus Prime to form a super robot.  This adds something special to owning these two toys that makes them awesome to have.  Transforming Jetfire to combine mode is pretty simple from his vehicle form and Optimus only needs the flaps on his back opened up.  There are four main hook up points.  At the feet where they snap together very solidly, under the waist, between the Optimus' legs, where they click together with a plate, with a belt that wraps around Optimus and connects around his waist and then at Optimus' shoulders (these are the only hook ups I tend to have trouble with)(EDIT - Turns out you should start at the shoulders and work your way down and there is no problem).  Some Jetfire flaps become a cool big gun and the gatling gun hooks to Optimus' arm too.This mode is astoundingly big and dwarfs everything else on the shelf.  It looks kind of manga-ish but really good (there's already tons of pics of this up).  The button in the back becomes a combined mode sound when you press it.  It's the sound of a huge machine walking and is pretty cool.  There really is something special about holding this giant mech in your hands.  The arms and head are Optimus' so are fully articulated but from the waist down he's pretty immobile.  It probably couldn't be helped.It's tempting to go 5 stars just based on wow factor but to be realistic Jetfire's jet mode has some issues and his transformation and combining are difficult.  I'll go 4 stars but really mean 4 1/2. :-) [SEP]"",""[CLS] Wow, what an awesome product. What detail there is to it. It also very easy to pose once you tinker with it and figure out. It also extremely easy to Transform, especially when you put in comparison to Optimus Prime and Mix Master. Some of the pices snap of really easily while transforming the figure, however that is to prevent any pieces breaking, you can easily snap them back on. I just can't believe what a great job Hasbro did with this product. In Vehicle Mode his parts aren't very well concealed however, and when in Vehicle mode he is very long.Now I already had Optimus Prime, so what a great surprise to learn that you can put both of them together just like in the movie. It is very easy to prep both fugure to combine, however it was pretty difficult for me to actually put them together. This is because it is an extremely tight fit. Once I put them together it looked great. Do not expect to pose the figure once you put them together, the legs are locked in place.Overall a great figure to purchase. I would recommend this for anyone who loves Transformers, you won't be dissappointed. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Like other reviewers have said, vehicle mode is where it's at with this figure...the top half anyway.  At around 18 long, this could be the most shelf consuming figure in alot of houses.  It looks great displayed in vehicle mode, despite all the kibble on bottom.  That can be ignored through squinting.  I have trouble getting the jet engines to stay connected with the rest of the main body.  The sharp parts are all soft rubber, so it's fairly kid friendly.  The fly-by jet noise is cool.  Robot mode isn't bad.  You can mess around with how everything fits to make it look more screen accurate.  He will always look a little wide.  Watch a video for the first time you transform him, but after that you should have it down.  His voice bit sounds good.  His 3rd mode is what most people will be getting him for:  The combination with Leader Optimus is great; it's the way I choose to display them both.  I personnally would have liked to see more involved with the legs facing the front side.  There are a couple videos showing different ways to combine the two.  Again, fidget around with it to your desire.  Also, there is a button on the back where you used to press for the jet noise that makes a combination noise. The small missle-firing gun is a pain to get to stay on.  Also, despite being very hard to find, I would still hold out a while before paying upwards of [...]like this website advertises.  Overall, a decent figure. [SEP]","[CLS] Awesome robot-to-vehicle figure features electronic speech, light-up eyes and chest and MECH ALIVE gearing that reveals moving armor panels and internal gears.

B001U3Y5XE,"[CLS] Too over rated and too expensive and too time consuming to play. I would not recommend this game to anyone. [SEP]"",""[CLS] idea of this is fun.  but honestly if you already have pictionary you can use legos you have to play this game.  we played just creating the the objects to guess never played a game to keep score.  fun game overall.  over kill with the lego options which no doubt increased the price. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Creationary is my favorite new family game in quite awhile.  I bought it with my 7 year old son in mind and it has proven to be much fun for him and for his parents.  Gameplay is very simple: players take turns building items out of Legos while the other players try to guess what the item is.  If a player's creation is recognized, the builder gets a point and the player who guessed the item correctly gets a point.  First player to 5 points wins.  On his or her turn, a player rolls the dice to determine what category their object falls under: nature, buildings, vehicles, or things.  Then they draw a card, each having pictures of items from those 4 categories, and try to build the corresponding item.  It doesn't get much simpler.Initially my son was a bit intimidated at the prospect of having to build the items without any instructions or help, but he warmed to it quickly.  Parents of younger kids should be prepared to make the game manageable for their children as needed.  If an assigned item seemed too hard for our son, we allowed him to pick another card to try another item.  If he had trouble building the item to his satisfaction, we allowed some verbal clues: is it a living thing?  do we have one of these?  is it a kind of boat?  By combining the Lego-building with a kind of 20 Questions vibe, we were able to keep him from getting frustrated and it was still fun for all.One thing that makes this game great is its flexibility.  Players can make up their own alternate rules.  For example, instead of one builder and several guessers, have all but one player build while the remaining player tries to guess the item.  Whichever builder's item sparked a correct guess gets a point.  In addition, we've created our own object cards using index cards with simple hand-drawn illustrations.  The allows us to come up with easier items for younger players and it allows us to extend the game's lifespan by enlarging its library of items.If you're looking for a game that encourages creativity, that's fun for a wide age range, and that's easily expandable, this is a great choice.  About the only downside I can see is that this game might frustrate those who prefer rigid rules.  There are no stated time limits, some of the pictorial item clues are open to interpretation (is it the actual Tower of London or a generic clock tower, for example), and some verbal clues may be needed particularly for younger players.  I think the open-ended nature makes Creationary all the more enjoyable, but others may find it distracting - especially very competitive players who might be more concerned with winning that enjoying the creative heart of the game.  If you like the idea of expressing your creative side through Legos, don't hesitate - get this game! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Lego Mania around here. This is a game of you draw the card, you build what you've drawn with Legos. The boys love the game, but I think that $65 is a bit pricey if you ask me. It is a good quality game, but I think that the price is a bit much for what you get. It was packaged appropriately and shipped expediently. Will use seller again. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Our family loved this game. My son is the big Legos fan. However, we all love playing it together. It's like Pictionary just with a Legos theme. Great for family night! [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a great game, but instead of investing in this game, I recommend purchasing a set of Lego Bricks & More that sells for about $50 and use your imagination.  With these blocks you can still play this game and it requires more imagination-instead of cards suggesting what you make, the child makes their own creation and it's easier to adjust the play time.  For example, instead of a 30-60 minute round, you can adjust the play time based on the time available-a quick round before bed allows the child to make one creation for you to guess in about 10 minutes or everyone can join in for an hour+ session.  Also, this allows the child to play & create alone instead of waiting for someone to play with me.Best of both worlds! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I am a HUGE lego enthusiast and I was very excited for this game it looked really fun!Well I was very quickly very disappointed!

What I quickly found was unless you know how to create models yourself without instructions the game is pretty frustrating.

B001U5JD9I,"[CLS] I understand this book is for 2-4 year olds, but my daughter could count to five before she turned two, so this book is a complete bore.  There is one sentence to begin the book and then all the other pages just has a number with whatever fruit Dora is bringing the picnic (for example: Six pineapples).  My daughter only made it through approximately two pages before she was done with it.  Really confused why they wasted their time and energy making this one. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I own the entire Tag Junior library.  Check out my ratings before buying books!  (I wish I had researched before buying!)I can see why the previous reviewers were disappointed, because it does seem pretty basic.  However I think the reviewer who judged 1-2-3 Dora to lack substance is missing some key opportunities within this book.  It is not just sequential counting 1-10.The book starts out with Dora asking her little reader, We're going on a picnic.  Can you help me count the fruit for my basket?  Each page features a different fruit (pineapple, bananas, oranges, guavas, limes, mangos, cherries, strawberies, blueberries, and coconuts).  While my 3-year-old can easily count in sequence from 1-10, he has not yet had much practice looking at a picture and counting how many of an object are there, which is what this book encourages.  Not only that, but for my 15-month-old daughter, it will teach number sequence, build her English vocabulary (fruit names), and both my daughter and sons alike will get a light introduction to Spanish, which I LOVE.  We are already bilingual (English and Arabic), so introducing the #2 language in the USA will help them.I rate this book 5 stars since a large age range will actually benefit from this book, as advertised.

We initially bought several of the books to go with the Jr., and Dora is definitely her favorite; I think it's the only one she really pays attention to in the Jr. series.  But that is mainly because it is Dora.  After reading her Dora book, it inspires her to read her other books though.There are more things about this book besides it counting from 1 to 10.  It teaches about the different fruits Dora is gathering for the picnic, as well as counting them.  The book also includes all of Dora's little buddies too.  And it has other little hidden educational/problem-solving things in it. For example, my daughter will land on the Dora picture for the 4 Guavas page.  It asks my daughter to find the other type of fruit on the page, which is a pineapple in Dora's basket.  There are all sorts of these throughout the book.  It also, of course, says the fruit names and other words in Spanish...  The music it plays when she lands on a blank area of the book sounds like the show's music, and Dora's narrative voice is true to the show.This book definitely is fun for about 10 minutes at a time, which is pretty good for a little one.  If you have a fan of Dora, this is a great Tag Jr. book to have. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is exactly as in the stores, and is a good deal on Amazon.

It builds vocabulary, it is entertaining, and it periodically challenges your older Tag Junior user to a book-wide search for things.  It does show the upper and lower case letters, which as an elementary educator I love.  My 3-year-old looked at me with a pretend grumpy face and said, that gorilla looks grumpy, like this.  I thought that was so cute and funny.

She loves removing it from rhe carrier we bought for it and turns it on to start  reading by herself. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My then 2 1/2 year old got this as a gift.  She loves her older sister's Tag Reader Pen, so we thought this would work for her little hands.  We've had it for over a half a year, and it's getting dusty.While the concept for the chunky reader is great because it would fit in her little hand, I must warn any parent who also has an older child who already owns the pen.  The younger child doesn't want what is different from her sibling's.  My daughter will still want to use the the pen, instead of the bulbous Jr. thing.And I also think that the Tag pen is easier to manipulate for all ages.  The Tag Jr. reader is not easy to use for clumsy young hands because the reader device has to be perfectly flat against the book for it to recognize the picture/words.  My 6 year old, who is very adroit, was even having difficulty with the Jr. the other day (she was trying to entice her little sister to use her own reader, so she could get hers back... to no avail.)  The pen is much smoother and more sensitive, making it easier for my toddler to manipulate.  Even without older siblings, since little ones like to emulate mommy or daddy, working a pen that looks like a big person's is way more fun.The books for Tag Jr. are geared to 2-4 year olds, yes.  But the regular Tag books are just as entertaining for this age.  Even if he/she can't really understand the total concept of the book, the pictures make neat noises and educate by telling parts of the story in other ways.  The little one can grow into the regular Tag pen and books. My now 3 year old thinks her sister's books are more interesting. These books are also fun to read with your child, and a bonding way for you to teach him/her how to work the pen and book.As a whole, I think that the Tag Pen is a better value for any age, and will be used longer with little ones.  If your little one doesn't understand the concept of paper books and rips them, I would supervise his/her reading for a while.  That is where the Jr. books are better geared for this age because they are board books.

I have Windows 7 and had ZERO problems:)  My only problem was turns out I already have a few accounts with LeapFrog and can't seem to remember any of my passwords..I kept giving it my 2 different email addresses requesting the passwords be sent and 10 min later they still were not, luckily I guess and got one right, now it is written down so that hopefully won't happen again.I can't comment much about the Tag Jr itself just yet as my little girl hasn't seen it..it was adorable how I was able to download her name already, just becareful, even the quietest setting is still kinda loud and she was downstairs when I was doing it and heard her name and yelled for me. I had to take Tag in the closet and shut the door to try her out.  I will have to teach her that to get it to go from person to person in the book you must pick up the tag first and set it down again, I was kinda surprised that you can't just roll it around the book which is what Im sure most toddlers do.  But I think she is smart enough to go along with that after I tell her.I think its kinda odd you have to pay for the books and then before they work with the Tag you have to download them, its too bad you can't just scan the tag over the UPC code or something, haha. That would be nice, but whatever.

When I would manually start the Leapfrog Connect software, it would not find the Tag or Tag Jr.  I spent hours uninstalling & reinstalling, using different USB ports (front & back), etc.  Nothing worked.  I was very disappointed because we had gotten several more books that we couldn't load the audio for.  I finally just left it alone for a few months.

Within that utility it made a report to send to Leapfrog tech support, and gave me an option to UN-install (which I did).  I re-installed, and both the Tag & Tag Jr. work (for now ... ???) My suggestion is if you're having trouble, call Leapfrog Tech Support:  1-800-701-LEAP  Have them walk you through this process.

You dip the closed loop in a bucket of soap suds, raise it, open it, wave it sideways and it makes really, really big bubbles. And then there's a bottle of bubble mix which, when added to water and dish soap, provides, shall we say, the ultimate solution for your really-big-bubble-blowing needs. Yes, it can get a bit messy and slimy and soapy. But even more yes, it will astonish you with your suddenly-acquired really-big-bubble-blowing powers.The instructions even include, bless them, a game called the Popping Game. You win one point for popping little bubbles (smaller than a basketball). But you lose five points when you pop a big bubble. Squirt-gun, frisbee- and finger-popping are all recommended. Ah, a bubble game. Surely there must be a myriad of such.As a matter of no coincidence at all, bubble-maven Stein has teamed up with the editors at Klutz Press to produce a handy guide to really-big-bubble-making called How to Make Monstrous, Huge, Unbelievably Big Bubbles. The Bubble Wand you get with the book, Klein explains, is the same size, but improved somewhat (tighter endcaps, 20% heavier fabric) and includes a bottle of  Big Bubble Mix which is enough to make almost 3 gallons of bubble solution.It's most definitely an outdoor toy. It's most clearly designed to be used by people old enough to be sensitive to things like a shifting wind and the soap-in-the-eye potential, and young enough to want to make really, really big bubbles. And the fun, the fun, is like totally major. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Happy. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Works great and seems pretty durable! Very happy.

My daughters have had fun with it from 3 years to 7 years old and it's still going strong.  They do have a number of ceramic tea sets that they prefer to use when they picnic so I think the basket is what they actually like best.  They load it up with play food and bring it to their picnics around the house and outside.We did have an incident when my daughter was four.  She was pretending to sip from the cup and her lip got stuck in the space between the top of the cup (there's a rim) and the handle.  It was bad enough that I had to get it off for her, she couldn't remove it herself.  Her lip swelled a bit and she was frightened but I didn't think it was bad enough to get rid of the set.  I just told her not to have her lip above the handle anymore and it has been fine.  Just something to keep an eye out for.Also, our forks have not held up at all.  We have only one intact fork left.  The others have been thrown out because all of their two inner prongs snapped off.  I have found them around the house, broken, so I can't attest to whether they were being played with roughly or if it occurred during normal play.  Again, just something you might want to be aware of if you have a little one crawling around, as I do.Overall I think it's a good buy.  I wish the cups didn't have that rim.

B001UIKQ8W,"[CLS] The Alex Jr. Tub Joy Quacky Cups can provide lots of entertainment for your little one in the tub.  Little ones find it fun to fill the cups and then watch the water run through the holes.  Additionally, the cups are quite useful for rinsing a little ones hair without dumping quantities of water onto the child's head.  This can be very helpful when an infant is the child being bathed. The gradual shower of water prevents shocking the child when water is poured over him/her and allows the child to get used to gradually having water run down his/her face.I did not rate this product as deserving five stars for several reasons. The quacky cups are made of hard plastic; this could easily be broken if a child enthusiastically banged the cup on the tub edge or threw the cup across the room.  Yes, I know your child would never do that - but some will.  My biggest concern is that the edges of the tails on each cup were not finished smoothly and a small child might easily be scratched by running a finger along the seam.  We took a fine file to the edges to smooth them off; I would suggest that one check the beaks as well for rough edges. [SEP]"",""[CLS] these are perfect basic bath toys.  My daughter loves them.

B001UK509U,"[CLS] I played this game at a Meetup on the upper west side of Manhattan. I've always liked word games, and this one is fun. You have to think, but you're in teams and you have 30 seconds to discuss and come up with an answer. Mind you there are some topics that will make you think harder than others. But the vowels and more difficult letters like Q, X and Z are not included. There's 17 letters total, and you can try to get a letter back on your team's side of the street if it hasn't gone off the board yet. Capturing eight letters on your side of the street wins the game.The game is easy to learn and takes about a half-hour to play. It's a fun game that makes you think, which I personally like. Plus it makes a great team party game. One tip - you might want to have the Scrabble dictionary handy in case of a dispute with a word's spelling. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Take all your consonants except for the ridiculous ones like Q, X and Z. Put them on your satisfyingly hefty bakelite tiles. Now, make a long game board, like a 4-lane highway with a divider strip just wide enough and long enough to accommodate all of your happily hefty letter tiles. Next, get together a deck of 216, often surprisingly laugh-provoking, double-sided category cards, like: The Brand of Clothing Worn by One of the Players, and Something that is Wasted, and Something Used by Scuba Divers, and A Word that Describes a Car Crash, A Title Used for Males but not for Females. Add a cardholder and sand timer. And those are all the ingredients needed for a new and notably Major FUN word game called Word on the Street from those frequently Major FUN game publishers, Out of the Box.Everything, of course, except for the rules. And there in lies the tickle.Designed by Jack Degnan to give a couple or a couple of teams of word-lovers ample opportunity to demonstrate their brilliance and/or befudlement, the game is a contest to see who, in 30 seconds, can think of a word that 1) fits the category, and 2) has as many as possible of the letters still in play, many of which are doubled - as in MISSISSIPPI which would allow us to move the M one lane closer to us, the P two lanes closer, and the S clear off the board, which would put us one letter ahead. Only 7 more to go and we win!Though Mississippi would in deed be a coup, it would not be considered a valid response to the category A Brand of Clothing Worn by One of the Players. To which the best I could do at this time is probably MAIDENFORM (getting to move M twice as well as a D, N, F and R once). Or would MASSIMO with its two M's and two S's be better?As the game progresses, different letters, and hence different words become more desirable, offensively or defensively, so the challenge keeps on changing. The best word might not have the most double letters in it if some letters only one space away from us, or more enticing yet, one space away from the opponent's goal. The 30-second timer keeps the game moving apace. The cards keep the game surprising and funny. The tiles are large enough for all to read. The board works perfectly in directing player's attention to the strategically most valuable letters. All this makes the game absorbing and delightfully tense, from the moment the first card is read until one team finally manages to capture the eighth letter.Recommended for 2 to 12 players old enough to appreciate each other's verbal mastery. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Fun game [SEP]"",""[CLS] Love this game. It is fun, competitive, brain-exercising, and just plain old awesome. My friends, my wife, and my family, have all enjoyed this game so much that some of them have gone out and bought their own copies. Love it. Buy it if you love word games!

[SEP]"",""[CLS] Word on the Street: 2+ players, Ages 12+, Average Play Time: 15-30 MinutesWord on the Street isn't limited to two players, even though there are only one of two sides players can be on. Players can pair up into teams and decide on words together when it is their turn.  The board is set up by placing all of the letters on the middle track. In this version, vowels and a choice few consonants are missing from the game...more on that in a minute.The object of the game is for your side to capture five letters. The first player / team to do so wins. How do you capture letters? When it is one side's turn, they draw a card. Using the parameters on that card, they must come up with a word and spell it, moving each letter on the board one space toward their side. If the word fits the category and that side spells it correctly, the letters stay as is. The other team can challenge the word should they wish with varying consequences for either side, depending on who is right.  Throughout the game, players / teams will be spelling words and moving letters in a tug-of-war fashion back and forth until one letter goes off the board on either side...resulting in said letter being captured.As an example...Team A draws a card and it says...A red fruit. Team A then comes up with the best, longest word they can using the letters in play. Any letters not on the board are skipped. As I mentioned earlier, the game leaves out vowels and a few constonants...you'd simply skip those letters and move on to the next one. In this example, Team A decides on Apple. They spell it out while moving the letters one space closer to them. There is no A or E on the board, so Team A will be moving the letter P two spaces toward them and L one space towards them. They still have to spell the word out completely proving that they know how to spell it.To top that off, the game includes a timer that forces players to pick a word and spell it before time is up. This is to prevent players from taking a half hour to come up with a long, regulation word that would severely crush the other side. In my first game, however, I chose not to include it. I was more interested in making my son think of a good word than him being rushed and come up with a bad one. If he starts getting good and really quick...I might have to include it.That's all there is to it. Players / Teams go back and forth, finding the best word based on the letters available. If some letters are captured already, players / teams might opt to pick words that don't have a lot of those letters in it...just so that they aren't wasting their turn.I personally love this game...not because I find the gameplay and strategy to be deep (it really isn't that deep), but because it provides me with a way of quizzing my son on his spelling and vocabulary while spending quality time with him. I also enjoy the flexibility of being able to play how I want based on who is playing. No timer...pfffft...whatever. Kids versus me...pffft...no problem. Timer for me but not for the kids as a handicap...pfffft...sure. One free phone-a-friend from the person watching television who doesn't feel like playing but doesn't mind being bugged...pffft...why not?This game would be great for classrooms, in my honest opinion. I asked my son about what he thought about the game and his final verdict was that he really liked the game. He said he enjoyed trying to come up with the best word for the category he was presented with. The best word, obviously, is a word that uses a lot of consonants in play...preferably a word that moves multiple letters away from my side of the board. The thirteen year old was active and engaged during the game, bouncing words off of the eleven year old as they were on the same team. While she jokes often that she only likes the games she wins at, I could tell that she enjoyed playing a word game that challenged her mind a little.  I highly recommend the game, whether it is for family fun night or for educational purposes.

The debate is definitely out there. I do know that when I take the headset off; it quits working completely. If it were on a timer, then the ball should still float while the headset is off. So, something is doing it. Hopefully, some one will get up the nerve to dismantle one,and show us how its done. Cause I'd like to know.

I purchased his for just around $75 and it was a good deal at the time, I see that now on Amazon it goes for half that now. Such is life!So he opened it last night and is still wearing the wireless headset this morning. He is intregued! The adults found it interesting but not for long. We adults can be finicky! But my 9 yo loves it, and that's all that matters. Whether it actually measures the beta waves in your brain or it's just completing a circuit, he doesn't care. It seems to work for him though. He can make the ball go up & down at will, at it was intertaining to hear his baby brother shout up! up! as big brother made it go up. Same with down.All that matters to me is if it puts a smile on my son's face, and it does. He loves Star Wars and he loves this! I gave it 5 stars because if you ask my son, it is perfect.

The rules allow to set up a game for  2, 3, 5 or 6 players or for 2 teams of 2 players each. the 56 cards in 4 color schemes are really nice, themed to the game.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] This is an adorable remake of an old classic.  The tune is so sweet, both of my kids like the song.  The clock is great for my 4 yo who is interested in time.  The toy is indestructible in their hands and the 1.5 yo loves to play the song and carry it around. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Our children's great-grandmother has the original clock, circa 1950's or early 60's. It was my dad's when he was a child, my brother and I played with as children, and when my children discovered it in great-grandma's closet, they too fell in love with it.The old clock, which is missing most of its lithos, is made out of wood, plays the chorus to the rather dark tune 'Grandfather's Clock' (Ninety years without slumbering, Tick, tock, tick, tock, His life seconds numbering, Tick, tock, tick, tock, It stopped short, Never to go again, When the old man died.) The original clock has a fine music box within it, that after 50 years of play manages the tune slowly and melodically, whilst making a tick-tock noise throughout.We bought this new, plastic, made in China variation knowing it would be different. For one thing, the design, while one of the vintage designs is not the wood-grain one that the clock I grew up with has. It's still attractive, pleasing, and looks like a toy from a different era at first glance.The music is the same, but the mechanism that is the music box is drastically different. It's cheaply made like most modern music boxes. It's missing some of the complementary melodic tones in the song, is sped up by about three times, and does not have that soothing tick-tock, tick-tock overlapping it, which is a real shame. That little bit of percussion, for me, is what made this song so special on the older toy. I find myself, with it missing on the new toy, unconsciously making the sound myself to fill in the 'dead space' where it belongs.The lithos, are of course coming off. And the hands of the clock stopped moving in rhythm with the music after less than a week of play. Neither of these issues came as a surprise. Our music box component is still working like it did on day one after more than a year.If you're fortunate enough to buy one of these that doesn't break - luck of the draw, I guess - it's not an awful toy. It's another music box toy to have around - and my kids love music boxes. The tune is one you won't find anywhere else, at least not that I know of. But I do wish I'd researched into how much an old one would have cost on EBay.If you can afford to buy an old one, it would definitely be preferable. As a substitute, this is pretty mediocre. If you look at it as a different toy altogether, it's maybe worthy of four stars. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I had this toy growing up- during the early 1970's.  I loved it then so much, the stickers wore off.

B001W0J17K,"[CLS] Worth double. Timeless, destruction PROOF. Builds into anything.... all young hand friendly. Pieces snap in and out. No biting required like Lego. My 6 year olds favorite block 2 years running. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Looks like I'm the odd reviewer here. We did not like this toy. The main reason being - there is no room for creativity. The instructions are not very clear but any child who has some Lego building instructions will be able to figure it out. The finished castle is somewhat sturdy but quite boring.Pro:It is somewhat big - compared to Lego castle 7946.It has figures or people and weapons.It has a catapult, a drawbridge and a portcullis.Con:The mechanisms for the drawbridge and portcullis aren't smooth. The portcullis is especially cheap!There are lots of 1x1s and not enough 1x3s and 1x4s to make your own sturdy structure.The rods and panels are not well thought out and have very limited ways that can be connected.Frustration example: One of my boys wanted to build a dungeon with a trap door, just like his playmobil castle. Unfortunately, this means he had to use the piece with breakaway wall horizontally instead of vertically. After that, he had to change orientation of all the panels because the panels only have 2 contact sides instead of 4. The trap door then got stuck at an angle when the bad guy fell through. So the bad guy was able to escape unharmed. He then tried to make the dungeon taller but did not have enough panels to cover the dungeon walls.Unless you think your child is going to be happy with the fixed gate-and-two-tower configuration, I would recommend skipping this toy. It is not sturdy enough for 3-4 year olds and little playability and creative potential for over 5 years. It is not even worth the $30 that grandma paid. A waste of money! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My five year old would heartily recommend this game based on how many times I have watched him go back and play it over and over again.  It's been almost a year, and it's still his favorite toy.  It reminds me of my days with my LEGO castle that I played with for years.  The toy is rugged and well made.  It's easy for small hands to pull apart and snap together.  Sheesh, you should see the neat things my son has created out of this one toy.  You would be hard-pressed to do wrong by getting this toy for your children unless they just hate building! [SEP]"",""[CLS] The obvious battle is Duplo Legos verse the new name in town, Trio. Both are similar, yet different. The Lego is straight forward in concept.One brick overlaps another, to build a creation. There is often a book included with ideas, as there is with Trio. Legos are slightly easier for little hands to connect, with their plump size, and build.The difference comes with panels, and rod shaped materials, to give a more realistic views. Panels slide into place, in the shape of windows, walls, and come with double sided pictures, which snap, or click into place! This is a marvelous concept, though somewhat tricky to fasten them securely. This transforms your structure into something fancier than, just bricks!I wouldn't recommend this for kids under age six, unless they've had previously good experiences with building sets. This is best for kids who have higher attention spans.In comparison Trio too is of good size, and comes in array of styles, and colors. Though, Trio's blocks have many holes,making building somewhat confusing. A youngster may become frustrated, on which side is to face upward. With time, and learning patience this will come.It is a suggestion to start with one of their more basic choices, to build up understanding.Don't begin with the assembly of the castle, instead work through an easier model, or build your own castle, for starters. The number one thing you want this item to be is fun. Take breaks, if needed, to avoid a breakdown. Let the child imagine, and take in what this toy has to offer.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] My daughter got this for her birthday, and it quickly became her favorite game.  There are a few activities to choose from, each with its own level, so she can start at level one and make it harder as she masters the steps.

There is also a number and letter game to catch baby fish in a water bubble and help them over a waterfall.  My older son has also enjoyed playing this game (even though he says it's for girls!).

Would be so great if they had a download process for the Leapster 2s to add new things to old games, but that is probably asking too much.  Someone else said they thought it was more fun than educational, and I would have to agree, to some extent; it does require some thinking with most games (except for Fawn's painting butterflies) so they are learning even if they don't realize it.I asked her the other day after giving her what is now her 7th Leapster game what her very favorite one was and she replied this one and the Disney Princess one she has (Belle and Ariel); so that has to mean something!

Sorry that I did not include those facts here.We need not to be let alone. We need to be really bothered once in a while. How long is it since you were really bothered? About something important, about something real?-Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451Synoposis of below text (ha, ha): Device is loud. Educational merits of device is questionable, as the owner of the device, a 3.5-year-old, has not asked for a 2003 cell phone in her residence in order to communicate via texting with another human being, nor has she burst into spontaneous ABC mode. Said child still has device, as her maternal caregiver is not a total ogre, yet is looking for the perfect opportunity in the future for the device to be annihilated.My kid does use this contraption once a week through her own freewill. Buttons are easy to push. Sturdy. Volume is loud enough to wake the dead, even in quieter mode. My thing is: why do three-year-olds need an electronic device to learn the alphabet when we can just recite the darn ABC song along with them or sit down with them and open an actual ABC book with engaging illustrations? For that matter, why do three-year-olds even need to know how to send a text message? Stephen Hawking didn't have this thing as a small child, and he turned out O.K. Most of us thirtysomethings just used our vocal chords when utilizing our phones, not our fingers, the conveyors of passive-aggressive messages nowadays. I would like to hopefully continue the former tradition with my children.

I do. Do I really want to encourage my kid to become a textbot? Um, no.Further Added Comments on 5/25/11: Disagree-ers: You're gonna tell me that a husband texting his wife instead of just using his vocal chords to communicate with her is normal?! (Yes, I have witnessed that scenario.) Or how about this one: Several days ago in Target, a woman walks in the front doors and approaches another woman with the question: Did you get my text?. After that, there was complete silence. Either the woman nodded her assent, or she just texted her the answer of Yes. (I was not looking, only hearing this interaction). Sociologists say we need language, and I agree with a death metal vocalized Yes.Even More Added Comments on 6/15/11: Every LeapFrog toy that I purchased/received as a gift in the past (with the exception of one which did not have the whole alphabet deal) was quickly passed on. Why? Because my kids do not need to learn the alphabet from a cheery, ear-splitting, electronically-voiced stranger. Does someone wearin' a Pull-Up really need to know how to text, to identify a composer, or rattle off a slew of multipication facts? Come on, people!

You could buy 2 if you don't want arguments but I bought one so they BOTH learn how to share and take turns. Wonderful job to the LeapFrog game creators, and thanks. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I purchased this toy for my then 3year-old son (after a moderate amount of comparison and deliberation with similar toys) with the simple goal to help him learn the sounds of the letters better. We've been disappointed with toys that pretend to be adult toys but that just don't seem to fool him or make him want to play with them for more then a day or two. So I was skeptical and had low expectations of how well it would entertain him. And to be honest, he barely touched it for the first month he owned it (it was a Christmas present though so he was busy playing with new trains, vehicles, building blocks, and such). Then one day, (because of it's size: it fit in my purse) it went on a doctor's visit with us. And that was it.I took the time to show him what buttons did what and how to bring up different functions (he remembered a couple) and he has loved the toy ever since. He likes to keep it in the car now and he plays with it almost every day when we're all driving home from work/daycare (which can be a pretty cranky time for him so yay!). He'll also play with it in the morning when he wakes up on the weekends if we put it by the bed after he falls asleep and give us a little extra time before we have to get up.Educationally, I like this toy as much as he likes it for being fun. He is delayed with his language so I like that it helps him with his letter sounds while playing. We sometimes expand on it and make up our own silly combinations... well, we do but he laughs at them and repeats them, which is the important part. As he gets older, he'll be able to contribute too and we'll be able to really make a game of it. I like that as he gets older and understands more, there will be new functions he'll be able to use on this toy (like the game mode) so it will continue to help him learn and be fun for him for a long time. As a parent, I love toys that have a long play life!So far this toy has been pretty durable. It has been dropped on concrete and had a 35 lb child stand on it several times without any damage. In general I have been happy with the quality of Leapfrog products and this one is no exception. It is a great toy, both for children and parents.

Also included with the house is a nice selection of furniture and accessories - a large bed with gauzy curtains, dishes, plates, silverware, groceries, hanging lights over the top story hot tub, an elevator, a dining table and chairs, a living room coffee table, and more. I really liked the fact that I don't have to buy anything more to properly outfit the house. The only thing seemingly not included was a Barbie! There is a chandelier that illuminates, a door bell, the toilet makes a flushing sound, Barbie sings in the shower, and the lights over the hot tub turn on and off.The house is very tall - almost as tall as my daughter, so it requires a fair amount of space available to play with it. The door of the house is on the side of the house, so it is ok to put the house against a wall without interrupting the flow of play.The elevator was the trickiest part to assemble, but once I understood the concept of how it works, it went right in.

There are no pre-punched holes in the mermaids; instead they come with tiny cardboard stands that fit into a slot formed in each little piece. You're supposed to stand them up like tiny board game pieces when you're finished. The stand pieces are flimsy, don't fit well into all the slots, not all the pieces are balanced to stand up where the slot is located, and it's not much fun to play with once you've set them up, as they keep falling over. Would have preferred simply to have a hole pre-punched, to make jewelry or a tiny mobile or suncatchers out of the mermaids instead.

I received it free in exchange for a review, but I believe it would be worth paying the price for as well. I actually counted how much there is and while I don't remember the exact figure, I know I got over $5,700, so they are definitely right when they say it includes over $5,000. The bills are neatly organized by denomination and all of the coins are neatly organized into slots, and none of the coins got mixed up in a slot for a different coin type.I was originally using short popsicle sticks as a virtual currency for my son to learn about the concept, but now that he is getting older and is able to count higher, I have decided to transition him to play money. I love the fact that this money is so detailed and realistic looking, closely resembling the actual American bills, so that when he handles real money, he does not get confused.Some people might say you could just use Monopoly refills, but Monopoly money does not look realistic and also does not teach about coins. I believe that if you are going to use it for educational purposes, finding a set that closely resembles your own currency is essential.I have not been able to find anything about this money set that I do not like, and would definitely recommend grabbing it to help your kids learn money management strategies.

B001Z54H3K,"[CLS] I bought this alongside a number of other novel office 'toys' for my husband's birthday this year. Of the Hexbugs, we also purchased the Ant, but overall I think I'm more fond of the Inchworm. Mostly because the Ant has some problems with collecting household dust and mucking up its gears until it can no longer move (the higher clearance on the worm, and its slowness prevent this issue from occurring with it).It looks nothing like a worm of course, though I can understand where the name was derived, since it does technically use an inchworm style of moving about. However, had they not named it Inchworm, I honestly wouldn't have related the two. The end result is much as I expected, a far more alien creature whose movements can only be described as vaguely creepy; which is much as I had hoped. I think my significant other will find it cool since he's a fan of gadgets and horror novels. You can kind of imagine a super-size version of the worm maybe invading the world with sinister plans in mind. Or maybe a whole fleet of them moving about in that slow, methodical way. Watch out Playmobil people!It's a fun little thing to watch as it lumbers to and fro; it's not fast at all, but I think its speed suits it well. My kids (2 & 4 years) love it; they got to demo it before wrapping it up. It does have mechanical whirrings, but they are not what I would consider to be too loud.There are two rocker-switch style buttons on the (very tiny) controller. One moves the creature either forward or backward, the other spins the creature on the four-prong base about to allow movement in absolutely any direction.All in all, I'm pleased with this little toy; it equally met the expectations I had for it. For anyone whose interest lies in these sorts of toys, I don't think you could go wrong. It'll make a nice desk toy too, because of it's slow manner. It's not going to escape and call for a big search party like its cousin the Ant.Edit to add: Some people are apparently perturbed that *anyone* liked this toy (thanks for the thumbs down guys!), but do note the following facts: We have owned this toy for a year, played with it occasionally, never broken it, and never had to replace the batteries. My two and four year old enjoy playing with it, and have not broken it. But they are gentle girls. My best friend's 'wild thing' of a boy played with it for an hour straight the other night giggling with glee all the while, and despite some serious manhandling, the worm inches onward. Just food for thought. Now keep those thumbs down a'comin'! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Daughter loves this stuff. The stores don't carry a lot of different ones. This one I have not seen anywhere. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I doubt that my daughter will ask what the science is behind this fella. When she was a toddler at the height of Baby Einstein popularity, this would have devastated me; now, I could care less. She is having fun with this fella, and that makes me happy. Easy to get out of packaging, and easy to use. Pull the little white tab out of the remote control, make sure both the remote and the worm is on and on the same band (A or B), and start pushing buttons. One button sets the worm in the direction that you want him to go, the other gets him going. Keep the heck away from fivers and under- I could see a gleam in my five-year-old's eyes that radiated destruction. Great price here at Amazon. I got ours somewhat before Xmas, and the price was $13.00. It is now about four bucks more, but still cheaper than what they are at Target ($20.00). Sometimes Hex batteries go on sale at Target, so keep that in mind. Anyway, last night I unknowingly dismantled some kind of pathway that my daughter had set up for Hex action, so this robot certainly gets the brain waves moving in all the right directions. My daughter is nine, and this toy is for eight and up. I chose this one because of the top positive review, its gentle nature (no scurries into dark corners), and because my daughter has control of its actions (she is easily creeped out by real insects locomoting on their own). Innovative, fun, and cool to the max. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a fun toy to play with for a few days, then, as most toys, it will probably get neglected. My 5.5 year old doesn't give it much attention anymore, but did recently show it and his other Hexbugs to his aunt.This bug moves relatively slowly, but the way it moves is rather unique. There are plenty of YouTube videos that show how these inchworms move, as well as how other Hexbugs move & work.One of the downsides to Hexbugs is the batteries and how often they need to be changed, but you can buy them cheap. Don't pay $6 for two batteries! Look for 10 or more packs of AG13/LR44 on here or the place that starts with a vowel and ends with Bay and save a bundle (if you can do without the fancy packaging).I'm rating it worthy of 4 stars overall. [SEP]",[CLS] The Inchworm is a tiny electro mechanical wonder that you control with a miniature infrared remote control.

I am so glad I bought this [SEP]"",""[CLS] To quote user Amazon Customer since I have the exact same experience (though I disagree with their stars rating):To turn on the flashlight you have to wrap your fingers through the cab of the tractor and squeeze the switch to activate the flashlight. In addition, this squeezing mechanically opens the grill of the tractor, but you have to squeeze it just right to get the grill to stay up out of the light beam.Overall this is difficult for an adult to operate and pretty much impossible for a 2 y/o. However, the 2 y/o does enjoy playing with it by rolling it around like a non-flashlight toy. [SEP]"",""[CLS] got this as a Christmas present for a 2 yr old boy.

B0025X444S,"[CLS] I purchased this for my almost 5-year-old for Christmas, and she was generally pleased with it since she is a fan of anything to do with Strawberry Shortcake. The set comes with a Strawberry Shortcake doll with scented hair (smelling of strawberries), and some hair accessories. But, the supposedly major feature of this doll is the make-up surprise - where there's a little make-up pen which works as an applicator. The pen has to be filled with water, stored in the freezer (in an upright position), and once the water has frozen in it, needs to be removed from the freezer and applied to the doll's face as it begins to thaw (the make-up will then appear on the doll's face - the eyelids, the lips, and the cheeks). If the make-up is already there to begin with, well, a bit of warm water applied to the face makes the make-up disappear, and the whole process is repeated again.Trouble is that this doesn't always work as it should - sometimes the make-up disappears after applying warm water and then begins to appear again (I guess it has to do with the temperature etc). The process is also rather tedious, and little girls are not known for their patience (or moms with other pressing things to do, for that matter). Final verdict - the doll is pretty and my daughter loves it, but the make-up part is rather underwhelming. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a must have for those strawberry shortcake fans. Arrived in great condition. Loaded with your of fun! Packaged very well. No complaints! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Strawberry shortcake is a classic!  I remember playing with strawberry shortcake dolls when I was little, they were always cute and smelled awesome!  My niece got this for Christmas and anytime I see her she wants to play with it.  She loves the hair extensions and the make up.  She tends to only use the make up once in a while since you need cold then warm water so the hair is easier to just pop in and out.  Plus for imaginative play the make up doesn't make a different.  She had fun with the stickers too which were used to decorate a variety of items in addition to the doll.

The doll itself is cute, nice size, great hair, smells fantastic! Comes with little stickers and barrettes (which are super hard to open) but the whole water/freezing thing to remove the strawberry on her cheek...nope, doesn't work.  My little girl still loves the doll but is frustrated with the fact it doesn't do what it was advertised to do. We have a my little pony that does the same thing and didn't work right either from a few years ago, so she was used to it not working unfortunatly.Buy this doll only if you want to do her hair and have fun playing with a decent size doll, don't buy her for the make up effects b/c your child will be extrememly disappointed.

B00261HR34,"[CLS] My son (just turned three) absolutely loves this toy!  It says quite a few phrases, the legs move and bend and there's a button to pop out the wings.  It's actually a pretty big toy, larger than I thought it would be.  My only complaint is that the helmet area does not appear to be very well connected - it looks like it's going to pop off with any sort of rougher play.  Overall I'm very happy with the purchase though.  My son's eyes lit up when he received this.UPDATE:  After four months of daily play, the wings fell off.  The manufacturer attached the wings to the body with a hidden string, however, so the wings don't get lost. They must have anticipated this problem.  You can put the wings back together, but you have to press the wing button a few times (at least on mine now) for them to pop back out.  So - with months of daily play the wings did break, but my son still loves this toy! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Now this is a review regarding both the seller AND the Buzz Lightyear I received. It was indeed not the Blast Off Buzz Lightyear as advertised, but the Spanish version. He speaks 10 sayings in English and 20 in Spanish. No way to turn Spanish mode off either, no, there's no button on the back. This is real life, not Toy Story.So no, I do not like the toy. I could return it, but I wouldn't have ANY Buzz Lightyear by Christmas according to Amazon.So, I shall keep it. It seems like an okay toy, but it's not the Blast Off Buzz that I desired and hence, it will get a poor rating from me.I rarely leave seller feedback in a product description, but I want other buyers to be aware that Bargains AAA are selling toys under false descriptions.

And he does love it. It is a cute toy and just like the character.My major complaint is at least three times a day I am asked to fix the back of Buzz. The wings are designed in such a way that there is a cover over the wings that, along with the wings, must be removed in order to get to the battery compartment, which itself has screws to get into it. The wings are held on with strings so they don't get lost when removed, presumably, but that initial cover over the wings merely snaps into place. Why? I don't know. The problem with this is that when Buzz falls, gets bumped, or is otherwise played with in the fashion that a spirited four year old boy does, the cover pops off, Mommy must continually fix because it's just hard enough to line up and/or snap back on that he can't do it himself. And, God forbid the cover gets lost, as it did for a week here in the land of many kids/many toys, the wings are useless and just hang from their strings!  Why, if the battery compartment requires screws to open, couldn't they make this cover attach with a screw ALSO? Do they not product test these darn things?Likewise the movable portion of the clear helmet often comes off, though not nearly as often or as annoyimgly as that darn back portion! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I don't know if our Buzz came with a broken wing or if it broke b/c one of our girls forced it open on the first use (i.e. didn't press the red button). It wasn't until my daughter accidentally snap off the sheild for the wings did I figure out how to fix the broken wing. Now both wings pop out when the red button is pressed. The doll itself looks and operates just like the real Buzz in the movies. The only problems...the clear helmet is tough to open, the legs and feet don't bend/move very easily, and the red release button for the wings takes a bit of force. The girls really don't care about these issues though- hence, why I didn't knock my review down to 3 stars.

I can't even tell you how many hours of entertainment they have provided.  Our pair are still working well one year later, but I wouldn't exactly say that they're real durable, but not the most fragile things either.

He really seems to think it's cool to have functioning night vision equipment, and I tend to agree.

It indeed provides night vision, but the range is pretty short.  It seems well constructed and runs on AA batteries.  Once the initial novelty of hey, I can see at night wears off, what use or how much fun they can offer will be up to your individual child, and maybe where you live.  If we lived in a more rural area, I could really see these providing hours of nighttime exploring.  We, on the other hand, live in an urban area and my kid simply isn't out wandering around that much at night. But, the bottom line is these do function as advertised.

I really liked that the craft items came in a nice tub so we could reuse the tub and add more craft items to it. Were were a little disappointed with the contents. The center of the tub is filled with crinkle paper (the shredded paper that you fill gift bags with). While it can be used as a craft item, you feel like youve been duped by a big container that is filled with stuffing to make it look like the container is full. After all, I get packages that have this same paper in it free as shipping protection.The rest of the items looked like they were the leftovers from someones kitchen: paper cups, cupcake liners, and doilies. They look appropriate for Valentine cards but as for real school art projects - no. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I would guess 95% of this barrel is filled with confetti.  Then there are a couple of small paper plates, folded, 4 paper cups, 6 paper cupcake liners, some odd pieces of red heart shaped lacy papers, short crayons, 3 blank cards, 20 paper shapes, childrens scissors, chunky glue stick, some corrugated paper (of pretty good quality), 4 big plastic buttons, 4 googly eyes, roughly 8 inches each of (2)tic tac or (3) ribbon, 4 pom poms, and a lot of feathers, and 20 odd pages of stickers (3   by 6  ) of letters and shapes including 4 pages of animals.These items are all brightly colored and appealing to a small child but they could have fit into a pencil box.  These items really feel like the bottom of my bottom drawer where I odd throw things children might like.  In fact, the children playing with this kit went straight to the drawer to get some better parts of things.My star rating is 95% based on the price, much like the jar is 95% confetti.

We didn't post them because I don't do that (I'm old) but boy did she love it!-The barrel contains a lot of good stuff to get kids going being crafty, but not everything.  For example, it contains paper, including corrugated colorful paper, lots of stickers - animals, letters, face pieces, a couple small cups, a tube, some googly eyes, some pipe cleaners, this weird crayon stick thing, some plastic scissors that don't cut well, a glue stick, and some shredded colorful paper.-The shredded paper takes up half the space - it's meant to be used as hair or flower pieces.  It's kind of useless.  We didn't use that much.The plastic scissors don't cut well- we made fun of them and my niece asked for real scissors which I had to go get.The glue stick is nice, but doesn't work well.  I had to go get tape.  Definitely keep some tape in this bucket.  If it were included, it would be a big boost.-But - we had fun with it.  I made an alien, and my niece followed suit.  We made up stories for each one.  They became friends.  We took videos of them doing stuff.

I saw paper crinkled and odds and ends from the bottom of the craft pile and he saw treasure, which I guess is the point.  The container is plastic with a handled lid so that in itself made my little guy happy to cart around. The craft anticipation built on our way to a friends house to open this bad boy.

Although it doesn't see very far, it is fun toy that actually works.  I also purchase the girl version so I have a pair.  It is well constructed and last for a few years already. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My kids love using these in the car. They  also like making things look small by using them backwards. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I had seen several other brands of kid binoculars in our local toy store, so was familiar with the competition.  When I ordered and received this pair of binoculars instead (Melissa and Doug is always a reliable bet, right?), I was really surprised at how small it was.  Its okay, since they are for small kids with small faces, but its not really a substantial item.  I guess the compactness and lightness can be considered a pro since it doesn't take up much space and it actually folds down even further.I do think the neck strap is a danger however.  I understand that part of the fun of having a pair of binoculars is wearing them around your neck -- but kids know that too and thats the first thing they do is to put the string over their neck.  My issue is that it really is more of a flimsy string, and not a real thick safe strap.  Its the kind of cheap string that twists up around your neck as soon as you put the binoculars on and start to move around.  Total strangling hazard in my eyes, and this is for an item that is recommended for as young as 36 months.The string is also cheaply done, and is threaded from back to front, rather than left to right, which means that the binoculars don't really lay flat on your chest, but rather twists to one side, even further promoting the twisting and the choking of the neck.I'm going to be removing this strap with a pair of scissors.  Total negative.The binoculars themselves are fine, and are sufficient for my 2 and 4 year olds having fun with them.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] We bought this as a gift for our four year old son, for sleeping one whole week in his own room for the whole night without coming into our room.  He got a little off track due to a death in the family but it's been three months so we thought it was time to figure something out.  Got the idea to buy a laminated wipe off calendar and put it on his wall to keep track of days to let a 4 year old realize how long before he gets a prize.He was very excited to go buy this at the store for his 5 days of being a good boy.  The next week he slipped up and got no prize and was very unhappy because he saw the policeman puppet the day we got the chef and wanted that also.So the following week, after realizing he really wasn't getting the prize for not sleeping in his room all week..he made sure to stay in bed for another whole week.  I did not buy these from Amazon only because we were trying to teach him a lesson and going to the store to get his prize was more rewarding.  I have already ordered three other puppets today through amazon though because I found a great DIY idea on pinterest for a puppet theatre and just got done making that today (see photo).  He had so much fun with the puppet show.  The knight, king and pirate are in his future.  He has to wait two weeks for the next one though.  Eventually we hope to forget about the sleeping track record and use the board for other rewards for stuff...like keeping his room clean or whatever. The options are endless.Things to note:  Hat is not removable but clothes are (in case you need to wash, they are velcro'd on).  The stick comes with this toy and has a piece of velcro attached...it can attach inside either hand to switch if your child is right or left handed.  It also can be removed all together and not used, if your child doesn't like it (like mine).  The puppets are very cute and built very sturdy I think.  I think they will last a while...probably will be passing this toy down instead of throwing it in the goodwill pile in a few years. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a good quality toy.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] We love Gamewright and have a nice collection of their card games.  Unfortunately, Too Many Monkeys missed the mark for my 6-year-old.The game is simple.  You must be the first to have an ordered row of monkeys (numbered 1-6) face up in front of you.  Once this happens, the round is over and you start a new round dealing the winner one less card.  The object is to be the first player with only one card in front of you and then you have to draw the card with one monkey to win.  Explaining this game is more complicated than the actual game play.Too Many Monkeys is mainly luck-based.  Your turn ends when you can't make any more moves.  A player will draw a card that kicks of a fast-paced card flipping chain of events.  For each numbered monkey you flip over, you can place it in the appropriate spot on the card line in front of you.  You can end up swapping several cards in a row...and it is possible to win a round on the very first turn if you've had a lucky deal.The game doesn't capture the attention of my 6-year-old.  We may play the game for one round, but beyond that the repetition and short rounds get boring.  I feel like my 6-year-old would have enjoyed this more when she was 4.  Personally, I like the game and the illustrations are adorable.

The only two children that are halfway interested in playing this game are my 4 and 6 yr olds. Everyone else (8 and up) runs when this one comes off the shelf. It's ALL luck... absolutely no strategy at all. No educational value either other than ordering numbers from 1-6. Rat a Tat Cat is an example of a card game (also by Gamewright)that my whole family enjoys playing. It combines luck with strategy, memory, and the educational value of learning how to add 4 numbers together (my 4 yr old has learned how to do this). I highly recommend Rat a Tat CatIf you are looking for an easy, no thinking game, for very young children (6 and under), then Too Many Monkeys may be a game you'd be interested in.*update...

It is hard sided neoprene-style that zippers around and is secure if you drop the leapster.  Great for trips.  The colors look nice and my son (4) can organize the items himself.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] The only reason I got my daughter this pink Leapster case is b/c I got a great deal on it with purchase of Leapster.  Its a nice item to have, it does store the game and keep it safe, it has fallen out of the car (while stopping for a potty break) a few times and has been well protected when it hit the asphalt, which we are thankful for!  My daughter has had her leapster for over a year now, and has 7 games...The only way they will fit in the case is if i carefully stack 2 ontop of eachother and leave one in the game unit and zip it up.  I really wish it would hold more games as she is getting a new one for Easter ;)  I'll probably find a small cute personal backpack or purse to start holding the items in after that.  So, overall...nice idea but again, not a MUST HAVE if you own the Leapster, it doesn't do anything special but protect the game unit and hold a few games.

I have just spent the last two and a half hours helping my son build it, while dealing with meltdown after meltdown, as the cheap piece of crap did not go together the way the microscopic diagram (with no text instructions) showed. I finally got it working, after taking it apart and rebuilding it many, many times. The one we did was a robotic dog. All that work and what does it actually do? The tail spins. That's it. UGH!The saying, You buy cheap, you get cheap was definitely true in this case. The premise of the kit was great - build 6 different solar-powered models. Unfortunately, the instructions were ridiculous! No text at all, and I had to wear two pairs of glasses to see any details at all. The pieces were ill-fitting to say the least. I kept having to snip off tabs that weren't supposed to be there, and file openings. When it was finally put together, there were gaps between all the pieces. Then, when I finally got it to work, and all it did was spin the tail, my 11-yer-old was so disappointed. He pronounced it lame and put it all back in box, which will probably never be opened again.

While most other toys start playing quieter or stop abruptly when the battery level is low, this one keeps playing at the top volume  but misses the words or notes (there are gaps in sound so that the kid cannot listen to the songs or music anymore and gets frustrated). And the battery life is not very long with it.

B00292BX8U,"[CLS] Very cute rocking horse. Assembly is a pain in the butt, but it is worth getting it together. Not that the instructions are difficult, that is very straightforward. It is physically hard to put it together because you have to stretch the rubber pieces in order to get the plastic frame together. There are three ways to assemble this and I have assembled it two of the ways. The first way is for very small children who need to be supported on the horse; since my children are bigger, I didn't put the support on it. The second way, it becomes a rocking and bouncing horse. I prefer it this way because my son seems to enjoy rocking and bouncing. Plus, he is able to have his feet on the ground for support (he is almost 36). The third way, is just a spring bounce horse. It is much higher, so he struggles to get on it. Once he is on it, he can bounce and loves it. The sound effects and songs the horse sings are fun and catchy. And of course the horse's mouth moving while he talks and sings is a nice touch as well. Even though this gift was not intended for my almost 4 year old, she enjoys playing with it also. Great purchase! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Love Love Love this rider. My 9 month old grand babies love this. Easy to put together. Very sturdy. Will grow with them. I wish they had it in pink too.

Now that we are doing math drills, it is nice to reuse the dittos, rather than continuing to print new. There is enough space to store many sheets of paper in the board itself. That also leads to this being a great device for travel. The markers and eraser click on.We had no problem with the markers leaving any residue once erased. I'm wondering if that reviewer tried to write on the board while still wet (it recommends to wash it with soap and water before use) or used a different set of markers. Crayola makes a low odor washable dry erase marker that it sells separately. I've had issues with those not erasing. Usually with any dry erase residue, a little rubbing alcohol on a cloth will remove it. You could also try a magic eraser (like Mr Clean), it works on most everything.I bought this for my 4 year old.

She received this as a present for her 8th birthday.  It was ordered by Amazon.  My in-laws gave me the batteries (needs 3 AA) and said they were new.  We took it home and it did not work.  I tried other batteries (rechargeable) and this also did not work.  We were about to return it to Amazon, but there were no more domes in stock so we were going to get a refund.  We were fine with that and decided we would just order a new one once Amazon got it back in stock.  Before I returned it, I reread the directions.  It said to use only new batteries and not rechargeable.  Since I couldn't prove the batteries my in laws gave us were new, I decided to go to the store and buy super expensive AA batteries.  I put them in and it worked!  YEAH!YES, this does make noise when the dome is going around.  It is motorized, after all.  It is not as cool as the commercial shows, but it is still pretty neat.  There are templates you can download and print at home, but the box comes with two already.  Or you can just draw whatever.The one thing I do not like about this is that the on off button is located on the underside of the toy.  I don't know why they did not put the switch on the side where it could be reached easier.  It just makes no sense.  All pieces must be put in properly for the machine to work.  First the inside plate was sticking up a little, so the dome didn't fit, and therefor I thought the whole thing was broken.We have had this for about a week now.  My daughter draws on it, puts on a show for the other kids, then wipes it down.  I am not sure what to do once the markers run out.  Can I buy more? It comes with 6 small markers that fit inside the dome nicely.

I then decided to give him a treat by putting the batteries in and he likes that too.  The criticisms in some of the other reviews are true - the sound is light activated so any shape or hand on top of the cutout will cause the board to say the name of the shape.  So, sometimes, my son will just try to get the board to talk by putting the same shape in each of the holes.  Turning off the lights in a room will sometimes cause it to talk too, which is a little freaky.

B0029NDZYO,"[CLS] My 2 year old granddaughter loves this puzzle. Once the tight plastic wrap was taken off the puzzle, and the two AAA batteries placed in the back, she was at it. BTW, the batteries do not come with the puzzle.She dumped all the pieces on the coffee table, and then proceeded to figure out by herself where all the pieces fit. She needed assistance with one of the cloud pieces, she had inserted it upside down. And, then when the last piece was inserted correctly, the sound of the train emanated from the puzzle. She was so pleased! A big smile came to her face. Very quickly she found that one particular piece when lifted up and placed down would elicit that train sound.I thought that after she conquered the puzzle, that would be all. But, she continued to play with the puzzle. There are small red knobs placed on each piece of the puzzle. This makes it easy for small hands to pick up and place the puzzle in place. The picture of the train is bright and accurate and believable for young children. The puzzle is made of sturdy wooden construction, but it is light enough for children to handle. The choo choo sound is realistic and makes for a very fun puzzle.This is a good puzzle for motor skills and for observation. I don't think my granddaughter found the underneath picture to be a distraction, nor did she understand that was the same picture as the puzzle pieces.I am usually very pleased with Melissa and Doug's toys and this was no exception.

B002ACUC0O,"[CLS] Wonderful detail. This was purchased for a 7yo.  His first experience with Legos, along with the medieval market village.  His grown-up brother had been a lego fanatic back in his day, so this was a fantastic bonding experience between the 2 of them.  Both boys at vastly different age groups love the details of this medieval village. It stays out on display year round.  Find it on a good sale, and you'll be even happier!  Very charming. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This was a fun set to build and like most successful LEGO sets, is filled with terrific details that make it so much fun.This set has the added benefit of an illuminated brick that lights up the inside of the toy shop.There is a huge Christmas tree with presents, a snowman, skiers, lots of cool toys and an interesting toy shop with neat architectural details.The original price of this set was around $60 making it just over 7 cents per LEGO piece in the set.Even though it is listed as ages 12+ I think it would work for a clever 8 or 9 year old that has had success at building LEGO sets before.I have some images in the customer images section that show some of the set detail. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This was really fun build and it has a lot of charm to it. I purchased this impulsively (as most adult LEGO fans tend to make their purchases) and was quite surprised at the number of minifigures and pieces included for what seemed to be a 'small set'. It may be small in size compared to LEGO's other models geared towards older audiences but all the fun is in the details like the Christmas tree, roofing and mini toys.LEGO does a great job enchanting even adults with their Creator sets and modular buildings. This set will definitely be a challenge for younger children and does require a bit of time to build (it is over 800 pieces). I highly recommend to adults, especially if you are interested in the more expensive modular buildings but aren't able to spend that much. The same amount of thought, detail and surprises went into this set as it did with the Grand Emporium, for example.It's definitely worth the price IF you pay the right price. With anything LEGO, make sure you check the LEGO website and other retailers first to get an idea of what standard pricing is before you shop for LEGO sets. Amazon.com tends to be fair but third party sellers on Amazon may not be. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We have a large North Pole Christmas village every year (Department 56) and one of the pieces is a Lego Factory, so when I saw this Lego set, I thought it would be a wonderful addition. My baby is 25, so it's been a long time since I played with Legos and I had forgotten how much fun they are!  The number of pieces is a little overwhelming at first, but we divided everything by color and that made it much easier.  I can't wait to see how it looks in the Christmas village and I may even add the Lego Bakery set next year.  In fact, it was SO much fun that I bought another set for my son, because you really are never too old for Legos!p.s.  I checked both the Lego site and Amazon and the prices were identical, so not sure about the review that felt it was overpriced.

B002B7JY66,"[CLS] Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger!  Is he real or just a toy - you decide!  I'm pretty sure you know who Buzz Lightyear is but if not he's a space ranger who's a toy, or a toy who's a space ranger... Just watch a Toy Story Movie already!  This is the Toy Story Collection Buzz Lightyear and just... Wow.For kids and adults:You may look at the price tag and think, Wow, that's expensive for a Buzz Lightyear, and certainly there are less expensive versions but this is THE Buzz to own whether you are a player (with toys) or a collector.  First of all the box... I'm not a keep in the box kind of guy and usually just chunk `em but this box is an exacting (aside from some real world concessions) replica of the boxes Buzz comes in in the movies.  Smartly the wings are not attached in the store (imagine the carnage) but are included so you can attach at home for display or when giving to that Pixar loving kid on Christmas day.  A very nice box for a mass market toy.This guy is a huge and bulky 12 figure and is impeccably sculpted to match the movie.  From the bottom of his feet, pointed knees, rubbery waist up to his cocky face with arched eyebrow this guy is Buzz from head to toe.  His backpack and wings are also picture perfect.Paint is fairly simple but all clean.  The work on his face, eyes, eyebrows, mouth... all look great and clean.  The only slop at all is the around the edges of the purple tips on his fingers and the green patches on his hands.  And speaking of the green - IT'S GLOW IN THE DARK!  He has a clean green color used to highlight many parts of his body, the biggest area being his chest, but you wouldn't even know it glows until you get him in the dark it's such a normal looking paint.  One downside is that some details, like warnings on his jetpack and his communicator and space ranger symbol, are stickers.  It looks fine and is movie accurate but as stickers do they will peel over time and play.Articulation is all high quality.  The head is part of the features but can be moved when he's not on but I would not recommend excessive tampering with it.  Ball shoulders and elbows offer smooth and stable positioning, the wrists turn and the four fingers on each hand move at the hand knuckle.  The only down side to the arms is they cannot hang straight down from the shoulder - but they look so good with hand on hips or in a more action pose it's hardly missed.  His waist is clicky with a couple of clicks to lean him front and back and side to side that add a lot of pose-ability.  His hip joints have a full and smooth range of movement (forward, back and out), the knees are clicky and also rotate (clicky too) and the ankles have a small range.  It may not sound like a lot but it really is perfect for this toy and more than you might expect and the quality of the joints is top notch.  There's a little wobble but nothing a steady hand can't manage.Special features?  This guy is ALL special features.  In toy mode he has a few phrases to say and standard wing pop and fold and helmet open and close and laser sounds.  Also his voice and sounds are of a more tinny and old fashioned quality.  But in Space Ranger mode he's much more interactive - or that is to say he has a lot more to say.  His head turns side to side and as the box says, over 65 phrases, and add that to the lights (arm laser and wing tips) and sounds.  His wings pop out at the push of a button and make appropriate noises both popping out and folding in and they do both well.  The helmet opens and closes and makes noises and dialog (depending on mode) as appropriate.  His laser lights up and makes movie accurate sound and his communicator opens and closes with appropriate sounds and dialog as well. Add on to that with wings out you can fly him in a horizontal fashion for swooping and swooshing sounds and when you make him vertical again he makes landing sounds and appropriate dialog you've got a feast of special features.  Oh, did I mention he has a microphone and listens out for you as well and responds to noises you make?  If you stay quiet he'll ask where you are and eventually enter hypersleep mode.  The only possible downside is that, yes, some of the sounds and dialog are sequential, but there are so many and they are subject to several factors that it's hardly a bother.A couple of things in leaving.  One, for the price this guy does a lot.  Compare to a leader class Transformer that may have 3 sounds and the only other advantage is transformation (but Buzz does have pop out wings and open and closeable helmet and communicator and glow in the dark paint) and the tiny bit more money translates to a lot of extra features.  Two, this is such a collector toy that it comes with that great box and an actual certificate of authenticity while at the same time being economical and fun enough to be a great toy for kids too.  And last, the box does not lie... I've easily cataloged 64 different sayings that Buzz says and I'm sure I either missed some or they counted some in different circumstances but he really does say a lot and makes many sounds and has lights and all.  Because I know many would prefer the sayings to be a surprise I won't list here, but the first (maybe only) comment here will be me publishing all the sayings I've found (because some will want to know) so consider that a spoiler warning on the comments section.  Oh and um, 5 out of 5, OK? [SEP]"",""[CLS] Awesome [SEP]"",""[CLS] Awesome [SEP]"",""[CLS] Great toy, it is already broken, but that is exclusively the fault of my kids, they throw it like a football...So the only thing I wasn't happy with was really the price, 15 dollars less would have been just great.But it is a great toy, the details are very good, and even have the name ANDY under his shoe.The problem with this toy is the quality. It got broken in a few months... [SEP]"",""[CLS] I love this toy, bought it for christmas for my boys last year. It's an exact replica of the one in the movie, and does alot of the same things and says the same phrases. I was impressed with the box too, just like the movie, and even comes with a certifcate of authenticity. The only weird thing is that the lights on his wings only light up in demo mode, i thought the should work in regular mode. And I wish he had spanish mode. Can't beleive i'm saying that because i hate toys with spanish mode, but since they made that in the 3rd movie, i thought it too should have been included wtih the toy just for kicks.He has survived the bashing by 5-6 year olds, which is awesome. The arm flaps could be easily broken though, so make sure the kids take care of him. A little pricey for a toy for small children, but then again most toys are nowadays. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This Buzz is just wonderful, my only complaint is that his wings are quite fragile. My son plays quite carefully with him, but even so the wings come off frequently and are now getting hard to put back in place - and it's only February. The talking feature is fabulous, my son is so attached to this toy that the Woody he also received for Christmas is almost never played with in comparison. I would highly recommend this, but not for a child who will be too tough on it.

Throw a frisbee then toss your chicken to try to get onto the frisbee in the least amount of throws. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We do not like this game at all. The idea of the chickens is super cute, but the scoring and play is cumbersome. I thought it was lawn darts, but with chickens, and it isnt. It's kind of like reverse lawn darts. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This game is hilarious!  Summary:  You have a frisbee-like disc you throw and then that is the target.  People each have their own rubber chicken and then take turns throwing them at the disc.  Every throw is worth a point, and points aren't good, so you want to get part of it touching the disc with the least throws possible.  Once a part of your chicken is on the disc you are done for the round.  Now here is where this gets interesting...there's a circle on the disc that could make you gain another point or lose one, so it you don't land the chicken just right you could end up losing or gaining a point.  The game overall is fun, easy to learn, and the chickens are hilarious and nice quality.  They are thick squishy rubber and definitely bouncy.  This game is good for adults and children.

The wooden pieces are very durable and cute, and she and her siblings who are old enough (age 2, 6 and 8) like playing with the pieces. They can't play it the way it's designed though. It takes too long to set it up and get it to balance. Then rather quickly the whole thing tips (say on the second person's turn) and then it's back to setting it up again.

She also has it on DS and most recently on her PSP. [SEP]"",""[CLS] So, why did I buy this game?Well, I guess because it was cheap, and it was different than anything else out there which I currently own/play.  I know these Lego games are popular, even more so now due to the movie's success, but I wanted to check for myself.It's ok.  There's some humor to the little cut scenes, the telling of an already-familiar story.  There's no speech, it's all grunts and laughs, etc.  But it's cute.  The gameplay is a little tough to get; it's a semi-open world feel with tasks you have to complete to further the quest, but it's no always clear WHAT you have to click on or do.  I've found things out just by mistake!  You mainly collect mini Lego pieces by interacting with world objects - usually by blowing them up.  You do some little missions.  None terribly difficult.  Your kid will pick up on it immediately.  The little scenes and screens are fun.  I usually kick around for 40 minutes then get bored and go do something else.  It's not an awesome game, but it's a fun representation of the Harry Potter world. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Kids loved this Harry Potter lego game. They are both Harry Potter and Lego Fans.

This game was by far the easiest to beat.  (Other games have taken us perhaps 50 - 75 hours to get through,t his one is about 12).  It simply needs more missions / levels.  A lot of the missions in this game are simply going to class and learning a new spell, which is neat but not much fun.  The movies and books were not just going to class and I felt the designers could have really added a lot more to it.It had some excellent cut-scenes, full of the usual humor of a Lego game.  But for the price, I would pick up a different game in the series. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This new game in the Lego series is great fun for Harry Potter fans, both adults and children alike. The gameplay is similar to the previous titles---Star Wars, Batman, Indiana Jones---but this setting and characters will probably appeal to girls more than the other games. No worries, there is still plenty of destruction and mayhem for the less gentle gamers.The 4 levels correspond to the 'years' at Hogwarts (or the movies, if you prefer). The game is extremely faithful to the storyline and there are great mini-movies interspliced with the actual gameplay. If you are familiar with the books or films, you will get a lot of enjoyment out of recognizing both characters and situations. Once you have played through the 4 levels, you have the ability to return to specific scenes to search for other items or just wander around Hogwarts looking for fun. A fun feature for the kids was the ability to design their own character by selecting each component of a Lego minifigure from a 'closet.' There is a LOT to be done and found in this game, including 10 short bonus levels. Success on the various levels is dependent on the learning and application of the appropriate spells; different people have different spell abilities as well. 100% completion, as in the other Lego games, will prove to be challenging yet FUN.We played this on xBox 360 and has no issues with freezing or crashes.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] My grandson is captivated by this game.  He reports it's the best one he's ever played even though some of the puzzles are very hard for him and it takes him a while to solve them.  He is tenacious though and eventually works them out.  He has been recently enamored with Harry Potter after a marathon movie session during a vacation where it rained a lot.  When I was in the store recently looking for a new computer keyboard, he strayed to the computer game section and returned with this.I'm not happy with the price, which I think is high for this sort of thing, but I'm happy that he's so happy with the game and know the problem solving skills he's learning while playing it will be valuable to him for the rest of his life.  He loves Legos and enjoys building parts of scenes from these games for direct play so the format here is appealing to him and he thinks the graphics are great.After reading some other reviews about glitches, I specifically asked him if he noticed things that didn't work correctly, but he said he didn't, so perhaps that's a more adult perspective.Bottom line, my nine-year-old couldn't be happier with the game and highly recommends it, so I do too.  It's probably important to note that he's experienced with such games and pretty bright so the 10+ rating is accurate and I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for younger kids who might become frustrated. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This game falls in line right along with the other themed Lego games. We have them all...Indiana Jones, Batman, Star Wars, and this one and the thing that stands out about this one is that when you're playing 2 players, it's actually split screen when you are far away from each other and when you come together it's back to one. The others don't have this feature, so I figured it was worth noting. I know that the recommended age is for older children, but my 5yo plays this with his daddy and loves it.

Then our second grandson came along, so I got my checklist back out.  Then a third grandson... then a granddaughter... and once they announced several months ago that a fifth was on the way, I gave up!So this is going to be one of our second grandson's gifts under the tree this year, which we thought was so appropriate, since - at 5-1/2 - he has already memorized the state capitals (which completely amazes me and is something to this day I can't say is true about his grandma!)  He will absolutely love this SUPER sturdy 12-3/4w, 16h map board (which opens up to 25-3/4w, with sturdy metal-reinforced holes in the top two corners so you can mount it on the wall if you wish - the outside has a nice, textured feel, while the inside is coated.)  Each state includes the statehood date and capital, with a covered recessed slot for the coins (looks like you might need a xacto knife to pop the covers out), and the states are color-coded for the release year.We have all but three or four of the quarters he'll need to fill this Collector's Map up; you'll note this is recommended for age 12+, and if you're giving it to someone who's only now going to be beginning a collection, that age might be wise... patience isn't one of the strongest attributes of the grandson we're giving this too (or most five year olds, for that matter!); he's on the autism spectrum, and is much more going to enjoy inserting the coins we already have than waiting around for family members to find them among their pocket change.  We did also buy him a National Park Quarters (released between 2010-2021) Collector Folder - which, by the way, is no where NEAR as impressive as this one - and since we have only a few more than half of those released through 2017, he might be able to comprehend more the waiting involved in true collecting when filling up that one.

B002EEP3NO,"[CLS] From the pictures, this looked kind of goofy at first. I really wanted the other Death Star, but that's much harder to find than this one. This one is still super rare, and I didn't fall in love with it until we put it together. It has so many cool scenes from the movies, and so many working parts. It even has a removable tie fighter, with a tie fighter hanger. It's got a ton of cool figures that I haven't seen anywhere else, like R2-D2, Assassin Droid, R2-Q5, Protocol Droid, Interrogation Droid, Palpatine, Darth Vader, Imperial Trooper, Luke Skywalker (Jedi, Stormtrooper, and Tatooine), Obi Wan Kenobi, Han Solo (Stormtrooper and Black Vest), Stormtrooper, Princess Leia, C-3PO, Grand Moff Tarkin, Mouse Guard, Royal Guard, and Chewie.It took four of us two full days to put this together, over Christmas holidays, but it was well worth the effort. The scale is a little strange, but it's that way in almost any lego set. We calculated that if they made a Lego Death Star to the scale where people would actually make sense, then it would have to be 2 miles across. So, they had to make some design choices so that a lot of stuff isn't really to scale. For reference, the real Death Star is 100 miles across. This set does mix up different scenes from two different movies. But, they're really cool scenes. A lot of the parts work, like you can crush Luke and Leia in the trash compactor and you can move and aim the Death Star ray on two different axes.The instruction book is ginormous. There are about 500 different steps in total. It's spiral bound, and you have to be really careful so that it doesn't rip. Overall, this is an epic set, and I highly recommend this to anyone who's an expert with Legos. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Okay, this is just awesome!  It was my 6 year old's dream to have this Lego set, he had a deep love of both Lego's and Star Wars.  It came quickly in a huge box all ready for the best 7th birthday ever.  The directions book is so big it is speak bound and there are four sets of smaller boxes within the big box!  Pretty exciting, it had my husband, brother and nephew all drooling.  I don't know if it is worth $400, but I find all Lego's more expensive than I think they should be.  It took my son two weeks to get it put together, but the end result is being awesome.  Lots of figurines, and multiple floors and rpms of the death star each with tons of details that are pretty fun.  Other then the price there isn't anything I would say isn't absolutely awesome about this! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Very cool lego set. Our son is autistic, so we tackled this as family project. The instructions are very clear, and the parts are in numbered bags so you can stop at any point and resume at later date. Comes with tons of the little lego men and women. It is pricey, but worth the money! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Great product and quality. I like so much. It is a good product and good price I would buy again. Thank you. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Pros+Sturdy+Great fun to play with+Clear instructions+Pieces are well sortedCons-Hefty price tagMy daughter and her boyfriend saved for this set for a couple of months, and they think this is well worth the price. They bought it over spring break from our local lego store, and it took them about 2 or 3 total days. They're in college, and both have played with legos their entire lives. Good thing too, because the set is enormous!You start off building it floor by floor. The instructions were very clear, and lego did a great job with sorting out the pieces. There are 4 boxes inside that big one, and each of those have numbered bags. You open each number when the instructions indicate, which keeps things moving smoothly. I know sometimes sets have missing pieces, but this one didn't have any. I've just called lego before, and they sent me the pieces for free, so don't worry too much about that.This set is pretty sturdy when finished. I have the impression that I could throw it at my granite counter and the counter would take damage. The amount of thought and engineering that went into this set is incredible! The trash compactor has moving walls, and extra pieces to put in there so your lego figures can wedge it. The emperor's room has a rigged platform that falls when Darth Vader and Luke fight, and the chair swivels. The prisoners cell is very cleverly designed as well-it not only leads into the cell, but a trapdoor leads to the trash compactor. The TIE fighter has its own swiveling stand, and there are a couple of elevators in the set. I cannot say enough how impressed I am with the attention to detail in this set.Although I didn't buy it, I must say had this been available when my daughter was a kid, I would have bought it for her. It's a really fun set to play with, even for adults, and with all the mini-figures, you can really have some cool scenarios! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I'm glad to hear that Barack Obama (a.k.a.

Assembly was relatively easy and took about ten minutes. Requires two AAA batteries (not included). [SEP]"",""[CLS] My son was enamored by this, he loves it - age 5 [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought one as a Christmas gift for my nephew.  Then my daughter received one from my friend for Christmas (what a co-incidence!)  My daughter and I finally had a chance to put this robot together this past weekend.  My daughter is 6, very much into science.  She is an advanced reader, so she was able to read the instruction, but I must say the instruction was hard to follow, I mean, not just for my daughter, it was hard for me.  I had to read twice to understand what our next step was.  Diagram wasn't so helpful either.  Small pieces were just so hard for my daugher's tiny hands and also hard for my big hands.  Screws were very small, but they were ok.  What irritated me was very very small nuts and bolts.  They were so hard to put them on, they slipped out of our hands several times and we thought we lost them.  As for the finished product, it is SOOOOO LOUD.  My 3 year old son had so much fun turning it on, off, watching it go on the smooth surface, but everyone else in the household including my daughter was annoyed by the loud noise.  There is an adhesive foam pad that goes between the baseplate and the brush to keep the brush from sliding.  Once I put the foam pad on the brush, it was almost impossible to make it fit where it's supposed to fit.  I gave two stars because the finished product LOOKS cute, not so practical of course, but it's a science TOY, not something that you actually use it, so I am OK with it.  Would I recommend this product?  Probably not.  Kids need to be 10-11 in order for them to figure out, follow instruction, and use the screw driver well with such tiny pieces, but the robot itself is so simple (you are just placing motor and putting the battery case on top), so kids at that age probably won't be interested.  If the pieces are bigger and easier to put together, this would be great small science project for 1st 2nd graders. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This was pretty hard to put together.

With so many crafty toys or items that contain small pieces, you end up needing something to store it in.  This comes with a plastic case.  You also get several skeins of floss, thick foam weaving wheels (very well made, should last for quite some time), and instructions that a child can follow.  The only assistance my little girl needed was to recall what was clock-wise versus counter-clock-wise.  I was impressed that they gave you plenty of what you need, and a case to carry it in.  This is how all toys should be made and sold.

You have to pick your colors and cut the right length of string.  But once you get it going, it seems to be doable for her.I have read some of the other reviews (including one that references the poor quality of instructions, as well as displeasure on the part of experienced crafters), and I am wondering if Alex has changed the included instructions and/or design of the wheel...

B002JCS7X4,"[CLS] We've had this wagon for over 5 years and it has been wonderful.  It is very sturdy, durable & safe for little ones....and bigger kids too!  It has a nice handle for parents to pull that moves up and down to adjust to your height(we're tall so it helps).The wagon has seat backs that flip up or down depending on how you want to use the wagon.  There are two seat backs that flip up, each seat has a locking seat belt and a cup holder.  The kids sit knee to knee, face to face, (which caused some problems but nothing unusual)and are very safe.  If you put the two seats down the wagon is the typical flat bed to lay in, tote things in, store water baloons,carry Girl Scout Cookies to neighbors, tote bags of Mom's garden supplies, etc.  We have used this wagon for every thing you can think of and more!  It has been to the beach, the desert, parks, etc.  Just rinse it off and it's ready for something new.

Every parent wants and needs a red wagon.When my granddaughter was one, her family moved to a new house. The playground is one and a half blocks from her house. Too far for her to walk, and when it is time to come home, too far for a tired parent to carry her. She has a carriage, but is not a great fan of this. The red wagon was the answer. She can carry her toys, snacks and water in the wagon. Her parents can pull the wagon easily, in fact they can pull a couple of children in the wagon.My son and granddaughter had a daily routine. About 7am, everyday, my granddaughter would point out the wagon, my son would put her in it, and off they would go down the hill to collect the morning paper. This was a routine that grew into such wonderful memories for each parent and child. I can picture the two of them on their morning routine, a big smile on my granddaughter's face, and the conversation between the both of them was priceless. I accompanied them several times, and wS so happy to see the love between the both of them, what memories for me.A great sturdy plastic body, easy steering, front axel with no-tip turning, and  Dura-Tred tires.

We should have assembled it earlier this summer (age 10 months would have been ok!) and now i'm kicking myself. I assembled this in less than an hour with the help of grandma. I am 26. Grandma only needed to help me hold the wheel while I hammered.. to  make it easier. Assembly was a breeze by the way. Instructions were easy to read. Let me repeat.. this was SO EASY to assemble!!! All you need is a hammer and maybe an extra set of hands for about 5 minutes. So we got it put together quickly and then pulled my son around inside the house for like an hour. He LOVED it.

B002KCNV70,"[CLS] I mentioned this in a previous review, but I'll say it again: as a kid, I never was into LEGO. The blocky proportions never really did it for me, though the potential was nearly limitless along with the block count. It may be because my parents never bought me any LEGO sets and the few I did have were bits and pieces from older sets, the whole of which amounted to drab designs that could fit completely in the palm of my prepubescent hand.K'Nex were always my go-to imagination toy; again, it may be because of parents since they *did* buy me two large tubs of them.Nevertheless, many years later, as I've gotten older and developed a taste for both Star Wars and imagination toys, I decided to check out LEGO's Star Wars line and decided to settle first on Luke's Landspeeder.The price actually wasn't too high for what I got. I know LEGO can be a bit on the pricier side, especially for licensed products like Star Wars, but I was pleased that I go so many pieces and mini-figures for the price.The end product turned out great. It was my first real LEGO set that was complete, and now I can't wait to get the next set for myself. I had wanted to get The Ultimate Millennium Falcon, but held off when it was in stock.

That said, I did order this from Amazon instead of Lego.com, because once Lego added the shipping and tax, the Landspeeder was only $3 cheaper than Amazon, and I also needed by buy something for my niece, so in the end, I did come out ahead on the 2 items.  Amazon used to be my go-to site, but now I don't trust them, and never order something without first confirming the retail price from other sources.Bottom line - love the Legos Landspeeder.  Amazon, not so much. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We really like this set because you get young Luke, Old Obi-Wan, R2-D2, C-3PO, and a storm trooper.  It's a great set, very easy to build, and very sturdy.  R2-D2 can ride sideways in the back, which isn't strictly how it's done in the movie, but at least he gets to ride along.We bought it at a major retailer (starts with W) for $19, why is amazon selling it for twice that? [SEP]"",""[CLS] Nice Landspeeder!Luke's Landspeeder is a nice small size set that is a good build and great playability for kid's or the AFoL recreating the famous Jedi-Mind Trick on the Stormtroopers in Mos Eisley plus excellent mini-figs!PRO's...- Overall sleek, well designed speeder. Has the right feel, proportion and shape from the movie.- Nice color scheme with tan and dark red accents throughout.- Left engine detail 'exposed' like the one in the movie.- Hidden trunk/compartment in rear. Lift the back engine to reveal a space for the lightsabers, etc.- Brick built Sentry Droid has a nice simple/effective look and is attached to 2 clear cylinder pieces on a clear base simulating it's floating.MINI-FIGS are just excellent. Luke with new 'wig' and brush-metal lightsaber handle. Obi-Wan as well has a brush metal lightsaber handle. Stormtrooper with laser pistol, black shoulder paltron also has a neat backpack with grey lightsaber handles as containters (use the extra black stud on top of one of the saber handles and the extra antennae from the Sentry Droid on the other handle to give it a better look and disquise the saber handles better). Great looking C-3PO and R2-D2 figures. Note on the box cover photo, they list the Sentry Droid with the other mini-figs but it's not a mini-fig but neat brick built droid.CON's...- Luke's hair seems a bit too long. Kinda' like the one from the Star Wars DK book exclusive.- For some strange reason, Obi-Wan doesn't have a hood nor cape/cloak.- Rear compartment too small for lightsabers. Need to take apart saber and handle to fit them properly.- Bland looking cockpit.- Sentry Droid NOT a mini-fig. A true min-fig must have a unique sculpt or print pattern.- Another Stormtrooper mini-fig with orange shoulder paltron needed here.Overall I recommend this set for the young Lego builder. It has neat figures and a wonderfully designed Luke's Landspeeder. Slight mod's here and there on the Landspeeders cockpit and perhaps add more room in the rear compartment can improve the kit but regardless, this a must get for any Star Wars fan and good selection of 5 min-figs! Get one now! [SEP]",[CLS] Special Edition Star Wars Lego [SEP],https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41My8lFKbHL.jpg

Looks nice, mostly leatherette material on the outside, and suede inside.  It has a metal lock snap for closing.  The round tiles are great, they look solid, heavy, and they don't look cheap.  Dice cups are also made of leatherette material with felt fabric lining inside.  A pair of white dice, a pair of black dice, and with 1 doubling die. It is actually don't look bad to display it on your coffee table.It would be more convenient if it has a handle for carrying along.  It is big, and a handle will really be useful.  I like an extra tile for each color in case you lose a piece, but this set does not include any.  The inner suede looks great and feels nice to touch, but that can be a problem after months of playing as the suede material loves to accumulate dirt and grime.  Construction does not look very impressive to me, the center part where it hinges is also lined with black leatherette that may not stand long with repeated closing and opening. Another gripe is the lack of a decent beginner's manual.  What it has is almost useless as the quality of the print is very inferior and the illustration is hardly readable. This is great for a casual player, but a seasoned backgammon player might look somewhere else. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is clearly meant for those who want an elegant item for a formal room or den.

Once arrived I was so impressed by the nice storage box and thickness of the cards... then we tried to use them. My son is 4 and had the absolute hardest time keeping his fingers on the small skinny letter track. If you have seen Montessori sandpaper cards you are aware of their size, and while I knew before ordering that the cards were small I figured the letter would take up the bulk of the card, as the Didax Sandpaper Numbers do. Sadly, these do not. Had to return and instead I purchased larger letters on thinner cardstock at a local learning store. Not as durable but my son is easily able to trace their larger letters.

Perfect for young kids, and teaches thinking and reasoning skills to keep the monkeys from falling.  We've played this tons of times, even my older son has fun playing with his little brother. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I prefer this to the other tumbler type games because of the monkeys and how they hang. A lot cuter and better than marble. I gave it a four star because the stick are plastic and bending after first play. Yes not a big complaint but wanted to post that clearly to a reader looking for information! The other issue is what is going to happen when we need new ones. The dice has color codes on it to tell you which color you can pull!! Either I will have to change the colors on the dice somehow or find the colors in the sticks. Hopefully the dollar store has multiple packs of pixie sticks so I can make a new set of sticks when the time comes. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Love this game! Our whole family loves it including my husband and I! My 4 year old can even set it up by himself and loves putting the monkeys on top. So much fun! It reminds me of a game I played as a kid called ker-plunk. [SEP]"",""[CLS] It is great!  My daughter loves playing with it, and don't mind playing 3 or 4 games before I have had enough.  It is almost identical to Kerplunk from the 60s, but with monkeys instead of marbles.GOOD  -  Monkeys probably hold the interest and appeal for small children more than marbles would with Kerplunk  -  Cleaver concept - the tube is a palm tree  -  Variety - the sticks come in 3 colors; the game also comes with a dice with one color on each face;  As my daughter gets older, we will incorporate the dice into the game so that it can grow with her and become more challenging.  Right now, we play as though getting monkeys is a good thing  -  Great introduction to games for little ones - teaches the concept of taking turns without the heavy competition.  While it is not a cooperative game, you can place the focus on excitement when the monkeys fall out--no matter who was pulling the stick.BAD  -  Design - Wish the base somehow secured/snapped onto the tube/tree trunk.  It just sits there, so it is easy to fall or move.  Palm fronds have built-in clips to attach to tree trunk, but they don't work well;  The two trunk halves don't really have a good mechanism for popping together.  Some of the clips slide into their receiving hole well, and some do not.  -  Storage - Flimsy box.  Very flimsy box.  And to fit the tree in the box, you have to take the trunk halves apart.  They have small clips that I am certain will eventually give way after all of the use connecting and unassembling.  Also, you end up with all these little monkeys loose in this huge box.  Will have to find a small ziploc to keep them in. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is kerplunk with monkeys...fun but lots of set up.  Would be nice to be able to purchase colored sticks separately for children that like to break them...

The youngest player starts the game. If all the sticks of one color have been removed and you roll that color, youre the lucky oneyou get to skip that turn!

B002QZ5E12,"[CLS] OMG!!!  This is the best. I bought Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Railway Set. It's a great wooden track set. The slopes and elevations caused a problem. When my son ran the trains a bit hard on it, it fell apart. Needless to say, he got mad. After trying to rig it myself, i came across this (suretrack)on Amazon!  I figured I'd give it a shot. AWESOME!!!!!!!!! Fits perfects with Any Melissa & Doug Wooden Sets and all Circo/KidKraft Wooden Tracks. It held the tracks perfectly together. As for the blocks that hold the slopes and elevated tracks, i just put a piece of tape on the block and against the Suretrack. PERFECT SOLUTION.  I would recommend this to anyone that has multiple layers on their WOODEN track sets. (I am not sure if this works with the plastic tracks. I have not tried it cause I don't own plastic tracks.) [SEP]"",""[CLS] I agree with the core opinions I'm reading from a lot of other reviewers.  I bought these for my two year old twin boys because they often have their train tracks tore up within minutes of being assembled.  I was considering gluing the tracks down, but I read many parents who did that and regretted it because it made the train set a static toy when dynamic play is a big part of the fun of these wooden train sets.I'm still mixed on the glue idea, but I've decided against it and I thought I'd see how these did at keeping the tracks together.I'd view this product as a little bit as riding the brakes on active toddler.  They can still tear the train tracks up, but it slows them down some and keeps the accidental tear downs from happening.  So, it didn't quite hit my goals of hoping it could keep the tracks together despite active toddler intent to tear down, but it's not really the products fault.  There just isn't a good way to keep a toddler who wants to tear train tracks down from doing so in a way that isn't fairly permanent as near as I can tell.Personally, I've mostly just resigned myself to rebuilding the tracks a lot.  My boys have been getting better about keeping the tracks together a bit longer.  So, presumably this will be less of an issue as they get a bit older and maybe this product will be better when the destruction is more accidental than deliberate.  Not that my boys mind.  Oh no!  A Crash! is just as fun as the track staying together in their mind.Regardless, I think these are a good product that do help keep tracks together just be aware of what they do and don't do and set your expectations accordingly.

B002RL7VN4,"[CLS] I originally got my son the duplo box of 71.  We had fun, but it was hard to make more than one thing at a time and hard to make a good house.This set was the perfect compliment to it and filled up the rest of the 71 box.I love the pictures and numbers and so does my son.The cute additions (dog, flowers, fence, window, boy) are great for imaginative play, and it's nice to have an extra train car to hook up to the other one from the 71 box. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 2 year old daughter received this Duplo set for her birthday. Overall it's a nice set with a lot of pieces, but it all depends on what you're wanting to do with Legos. Do you want to build? Or play matching games? Do you already own a whole slew of Legos and now you're looking for some novelty pieces? If so, then this set would definitely fit the bill.This set is great for novelty pieces, like the double-decker four peg pieces which each have a number or corresponding number of items. They would be great fun for playing little number games with (my daughter is still a little on the young side of this, but this may be neat later). This set also contains one cute little person who can be made to attach standing, or laying, or sitting on any Lego piece, and his pal, a dalmation dog. My daughter loves the dog. There is a single window, and a little standard Lego car. The white fence is a great novelty piece too.The problem with this set (or advantage depending on your perspective) is that there are too many novelty pieces, and too few basic building pieces. This set is sorely lacking in the rectangular pieces which are so necessary to building just about any structure. The novelty pieces are pretty cool, and I imagine as we amass more basic Lego bricks, we'll have a whole new appreciation for the novelty pieces, but the bottom line is that if you are wanting a building set, I would start with something more basic than this.I think one area in which Lego has gone astray is in adding too much to a lot of their sets in an effort to make them more educational, or less centered on the classic (boring?) building aspect of Legos, which was/is in fact the most educational part anyway. And besides building is fun. That said, I think this set does sit comfortably astride the line between overkill in that department and being just simple enough to have multiple practical uses.For anyone new to Legos, or who is balking at the $25 price tag, I think it is worth mentioning that the ABS plastic used by Lego is quite safe and durable, and that many basic Lego bricks are still manufactured in European countries, which is pretty outstanding when you consider how big the company is. That, of course, is another reason to stick to basic block sets. All sets that have the more fancy pieces are going to contain parts manufactured in China, and this set is no exception. I think the countries listed on the back of the box were China, Mexico, Hungary and Germany, if memory serves. However, of China-made toys, Lego has one of the cleanest records of all those tested with XRF technology by the Ecology Center - which is better than could be said of a lot of toy companies. Bottom line: I think you can have a bit more faith in the integrity of Legos than of a lot of toys on the market. But that's just my opinion.Anyway, I wouldn't necessarily pass up this set. The possibility for games with numbers is cool, the novel pieces are nice, and there are a few basics like the car, but I would recommend at least one basic Duplo block set and a large baseplate being in your collection before adding this one. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The quality you expect and hope remains with the Lego brand!  This is a basic introductory set that includes 10 blocks with the printed numbers on them, along with 10 other blocks with a corresponding quantity (set also includes other pieces).  This is appropriate to just straight play with, but also as your child gets older it can be used to match the numbers with the quantity it represents. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My daughter got some money for Christmas, and this was one of the things that she wanted to get with it. She likes matching the number with tthe items, as well as putting thing together and playing wtih the man and the doggie, and having the man ride the car.

Very easy to combine the two and make even more stuff. It definately allows her to use her imagination.Althought the box says age 2 to 5, the pieces will not pass the standard toilet paper roll test, so if you have a child who puts things in their mouth, you might want to keep an eye on them with this. Also, my daughter is 5 1/2 and she still enjoys playing with it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I love all Lego Duplo sets. This one is great for its educational value.

B002S52VU2,"[CLS] For around fifteen dollars this is a nice Trackmaster starter set.  This is a plastic, battery operated Thomas that runs on plastic track.  It is not compatible with the better-known wooden sets.  The train has a plastic hook for connecting additional cars.  The train goes pretty fast, and it uses 1 AA battery which lasts a long time.  To put the battery in, pull down on the middle wheels while lifting the top off.I am only giving this four stars because the set does not include Thomas' coaches Annie and Clarabel.  These are hard to find.  Before Trackmaster started making this, it was made by Tomy.  You might find Annie and Clarabel on eBay if you search for Tomy.This is a very basic loop of track and one engine.  You will want to expand it by buying additional track, coaches and engines.We have some of the wooden trains and some of the battery operated plastic trains, and our children tend to play more with the battery operated plastic trains.

The red house/station doesn't have any lights/sounds/phrases like most of them do and it feels cheaper/lighter than other ones we've owned. It also doesn't have any fun stickers or designs like the other stations we've purchased which show people inside, or little benches on the outside with people sitting.

She loves it, and I was really surprised by how quickly she figured it out!Thomas also runs on carpet, so when she made Thomas go on her unfinished track, and he kept on going right under the couch, she found that to be hilarious. Considering how small Thomas is and only uses one AA battery, I was surprised by how fast he moved and how much terrain he can traverse. Plastic track to bridge made out of toddler shoes and a tissue box, right off track and over berber carpet and an area rug! Our cats enjoy it too! ...but don't buy it here unless they lower the price. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is my almost 1-1/2 year old's first train. He was playing with a Thomas at his cousin's house so I thought I'd get him one.  I was unsure about whether to get a motorized or non-motorized set but I decided to go with motorized to see if he would enjoy watching the train go on its own.  When he first got it, he was a bit startled when the train moved by itself around the track. That didn't last long and he started to play with Thomas for hours per day on and off the track.  At first (16 mo) he preferred for the train to be turned off but now (17mo) he prefers it on and likes to watch it go.  He has also learned how to turn Thomas on and off which he couldn't do for a while. I am impressed that the toy can be played with in the off position because I expected the wheels to lock but they don't and are fully functional.  When the train is on, he often holds on to the wheels and listens to them click.  This is obviously not good for the toy but miraculously, it just keeps going.  Only time will tell how long Thomas will survive the wrath my little guy.The station that comes with this set is cute but he pretty much ignores it.  I think it's just because he's too young right now.Putting the track together was extremely easy and there were some stickers that needed to be put on the station but all of that took very little time.  The only problem I had was installing the battery (not included) and the instructions didn't explain it too well.  After a few minutes of trial and error, I finally figured it out.  If you need help with that read on.How to take the train apart to install the battery (1 AA):1. Get a small Phillips screw driver (about 2-3mm wide)2. Unscrew the screw at the bottom of the train (there are several screws on the bottom but only the one in the center can be unscrewed).  After unscrewing, pull on the center wheels and a small piece will come out with screw inside of it (don't bother trying to shake the screw out).3. Pull the entire casing of the train off.  To take apart, hold on to the red base with one hand and with the other hand press both sides of the blue casing in the center (near the #1s on the train),  pull apart and it should come off easily.UPDATE (March 2012): My son will be turning 3 in a few months.  There have been many, many, many more Thomas trains, tracks, destinations (structures like train stations or buildings).  We have the wooden sets and the plastic sets.  The wooden, plastic and metal trains.  We have duplo.  There's probably more, but you get the picture.  After over a year of the Thomas experience, I've learned a lot.  My recommendation at this point would be NOT to buy Trackmaster until the child is close to 3.  Why? The child tends to leave the train on and laying around somewhere so the parent constantly has to find where the noise is coming from and turn it off.  CONSTANTLY.  You will also be changing batteries all of the time (rechargeables definitely recommended).  Since we purchased this set, we only bought a Percy and some cars.  The Thomas is now broken. Some of the cars are broken too.  The plastic does not stand up to the abuse.At the time, I didn't think that pushing a train around would be a fun thing which is why I gravitated to the battery powered train.  How wrong I was.  He loves pushing the trains around which is another reason the Thomas train broke.  He would turn it on and then push it around.We will be returning to Trackmaster soon for more trains & track.  We still have the track & station from this set & they've both held up well.

B002SJMR20,"[CLS] Nice,compact design that allows for fun and clever storage. My 7 year-old enjoys all the games and plays with us as well as his friends. We could take it with us on a trip if we wanted- stays together well. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This isn't too small or big, and it doesn't feel cheap. The pieces glide nicely. However, my first set was missing a white pawn. Thankfully, Amazon return is great, so I was able to replace it with a complete set, though I wish I could've received only the one white pawn. (I asked the company, but the company handled only the shipping part. Oh well, I don't like that part of the streamlined modern way of commerce, sigh.) Then, the new set came with an extra black pawn. But I wasn't about to return it over that.After seeing two sets, there was an update with the second set. The first set had checker pieces that were straight flat discs. The second set had checker pieces that had grooves and a slight raised section to make the kinged stack stay more stable. Despite preferring the flat, simple look, the raised section was a nice addition. I don't know which one you will receive.Despite the quality-control issue, I'm giving it a 5-star review because it's a handsome set, and any QC issues would be handled swiftly if you encountered any. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this set for my 6 year old grandson who learned to play checkers.  He was unbeaten until Grandpa became too competitive.  I thought this would be set he could grow into and learn to play chess, backgammon as he got older.  First glance out of the book--looked nice.  On closer inspection scratches and flaws in finish.  A crack in the actual frame. Fiberboard edge clearly showing.  But the biggest disappointment, there are no checkers.  Just cheap plain very small plugs of wood in uneven finish and poor quality wook.  How do you play checkers if you cannot get kinged  You have to have the crown to feel successful.

B002SOUDXU,"[CLS] Purchased 2 in different colors for my 5 and 2 yr old. They both learned fairly quick how to use the scooter. Easy steering. Love the improvements made to these newer models. A great long term item the kids can grow with. Highly recommend. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Good quality scooter. The metal part on the back where the brake is vibrates and causes noises. It doesn't take away from the brakes functionality, it just bothers me (my son and husband claimed to not notice until I brought it to their attention).  To turn the scooter, you lean the handles to the side in the direction you want to go. It doesn't make sharp turns, but I'm actually ok with that because it decreases the possibility of the scooter destabilizing when the wheel turns 90 degrees like on some other scooters  (or wagons).  We got this for my son when he was 3 and he rode it very well then. I don't let him ride on our sidewalk because we have places that where the sidewalk slabs meet that are not at all flush with each other and I'm afraid with the small wheels of the scooter, he'll go over the big bumps and the wheels will catch on the bump and he'll go flying off. So, instead, we go to a park where the walk path is very smooth.  It's great that the front has 2 wheels instead of the back, so when when he kicks, he's not kicking a wheel. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Best scooter ever!!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Got this for my 4 year old timid daughter and she has no problem using it. She just has one foot on and one off but it doesn't tip over which on two wheel scooters she doesn't like. She's too big for jr scooter but this one is perfect. Weight limit says it holds up to 110lbs but my husb is like 180 and he was able to test it out [SEP]"",""[CLS] Awesome scooter. What can I say? It is just so much fun for my 4 year old daughter. She zooms up and down the block with her neighborhood friends, who also have this scooter. Everyone loves it! Great for encouraging exercise and outdoor play!

We had received lavender ones or used oneS.  We bought this for our 41 tall just turned 3 year old.  Fits perfect at lowest setting.  And it's his first scooter of any kind and he just sails around house. He loves it!  I love it.  Sturdy and such a beautiful blue. Rich royal blue.  Thank you, finally. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Our four year old outgrew his first scooter and is loving this one! It is well made. Even his Mother can ride it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is one of those great products that no one ever hears about because the Razor line just about has the market cornered. Yes those are less expensive, but if you purchase this maxi kick scooter at the right time for your child (about 3 years or so), it will end up being a very inexpensive toy over time. I paid $130 for this neon pink/black maxi kick scooter, and I figure it should last my three and a half year old another eight years plus.... that's only $16 dollars a year.The maxi scooter measures 24 in. high at it's lowest setting and that suits my 41 in. daughter very well. I almost purchased the mini kick, but so glad now that I didn't since the maxi is adjustable and has a slightly larger platform.I will concede this scooter is made in China just as the Razors are, but the components on the kick line of scooters are much better quality... the wheels, bearings, etc.The steering column does not fold down, but rather locks into place, or is removed with a push button mechanism. It can be a bit awkward to push the button to remove the column. I find that a small flat-head screwdriver works well for this. The height adjustment is a simple, but reliable quick release. The hand grips are really rubbery and provide excellent grip. The deck has no grip tape, but does seem to provide adequate slip protection as my daughter was riding through puddles yesterday. The deck has just the amount of flex one might expect a child's scooter to have, which really helps the carving effect one gets from the unique steering mechanism. The front wheels have a camber to them when turning.... think Can-Am roadster. The wheels are super smooth and ultra quiet on our hardwood, tile carpet, and outside on pavement.I was a little worried about my girl not getting the hang of the rear brake, but boy was I wrong. Once I showed it to her, she immediately began practicing with it. We had a couple rainy days at Christmas, so she got to practice inside before heading out. She seemed really confident right from the start. I'm so glad we paid a little more and went with the front three wheeled design. Our neighbor's child got a rear three wheeled scooter and she is constantly kicking the rear wheels when she pushes, regardless of which foot she uses. My girl is able to take big long confident strides when she pushes without kicking any wheels.If you are reading this debating between the maxi or mini, your child is probably going to fit the maxi at it's lowest setting. If you are here debating between a front or rear three wheeled design, I promise your child will be happier with this design if given the choice. Micro Mobility started out designing scooters for adults, and have since delivered a well designed quality line of children's scooters. It really is a great little scooter, and in my opinion far superior to the half a dozen different scooters belonging to the children in this cul-de-sac.**UPDATE 11-24-2014**Scooter is holding up great. Very well built. All the other kids in the neighborhood love to ride it because of the two wheels in front design, along with the built in 'camber'. I would buy this over again in a heartbeat. I've only raised the handle up about an inch from last year, so I firmly believe it will last our daughter for seven more years. Updating from 4 to 5 stars!**UPDATE 1-24-2016**Daughter is now 46 inches tall and still have tons of room to adjust the handlebars up as she grows. Scooter is in great shape, but she hasn't hit the half-pipe with it either. Seriously, this scooter is a really good buy despite the higher price than other scooters. She has been riding it about everyday for over two years now and I still believe she will get another 4-5 years out of it.****UPDATE 10/11/2017****Still going strong! We keep it in the garage so it isn't subjected to the elements. A little sun fading on the grips and a few nicks here and there but otherwise still in excellent shape. Our daughter prefers this to her bike so it gets ridden just about everyday at some point. A great value if you buy early.. around age 3 or so. I said she would likely get 8 years out of this scooter when I wrote the review in 2013. Well it's been almost 4 years now and I still feel she will get 3-4 more years of enjoyment from this scooter.Thanks for the time and if you have any questions feel free to ask and I will answer as best I can.SPO [SEP]","[CLS] The Micro Maxi kickboard is designed for elementary school-age kids.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a great board game to play with children and with friends who might quite not be into board games. It's a game that is easy to set up and take down and with only a few rules to learn. The object of the game is to be the last one standing. During your turn, you decide on a tile to place in front of your stone. Your stone follows the path of tile until it reaches the end of the tile. It could essentially move forward, left right or even backwards. Other players place tiles down in front of their own marker, taking care to avoid paths that could lead them onto the edge of the board or into another player's marker (these are the losing conditions). The game is easy to learn but becomes quite intense as the space on the board fills up and there are only so many decisions left before eventually all but one players falls of the board.It's a great light game that is both elegant and beautiful.

But T'suro is a game where you try to keep from falling off the board or ramming into other players, as either of those conditions render you out.Tsuro, the way of the path, is a game of chance and close calls.  It is a tile laying game on a beautifully illustrated grid.  On your turn, you play one of your tiles in front of your dragon token and follow the path in front of your dragon.  Each tile has four paths on them.  If the tile you play is in front of another player's dragon, they get to move ahead as you do, for better or worse.If you take a path that leads you off the board you are out.  If you take a path that rams you into another dragon you are out.  Duh, dragons tell no tales.I hate to tell you what to do but...Naturally you want to steer clear of your opponents as if you and they are facing the same empty space, they will likely try to keep themselves in, and knock you out.  Try to plan to have more empty spaces ahead of you than others, meaning you may need to point yourself towards greener pastures on purpose.  Everyone will eventually have no choise but to send themselves off, you want to be forced to do that last.ThemeI don't feel like a dragon, or a greco legend either.  I feel like I'm trying to ensure I'm the last man standing. So the theme feels pretty weak to me.BalanceI guess since it's a crap-shoot for everyone, it's pretty balanced, but only in the bad way.  It is most often a short game (read 15-25 minutes), so the player elimination isn't usually too bad.InteractionThis is tough, it's all up to you and yours.Learning CurveOh so low.  My four year old can play the dragon game so if you can't...  The  So the rules are like two doubles sided pages- with pictures.  Easy peesey.DowntimeYou do have to wait your turn, but people only have three tiles they can choose from so paralysis should be limited.  Sometimes you can have your piece moved when a player puts a tile down in the shared space ahead of the two of your, but you know this is coming so, no surprise.Whats not to Like?It's ease of play leaves me a little wanting.  The player elimination isn't my forte, but the speed of the game helps.  It's a very light filler game.

Quite good plus, putting lego together is awesome!  :) [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a great little game that you basically build first and then start playing (separate well detailed instructions for building and playing are included). The building part takes maybe 20 to 60 minutes depending upon age and then the game is ready to be played by up to four parties at once. The object of the game is get two or three out of your side's three play figures to the temple in the middle of the board while avoiding the minotaur and attempts by other teams to set up walls to block your path. Very, very simple rules but a great deal of fun. LEGO even encourages owners to add their own rules (and the rule booklet suggests some examples). I was not sure my three year old would understand the game and have fun, but he did and is still pestering Mom and Dad to play it regularly.My only caveat about the game is that at the original retail price of $66 it is overpriced. But, if you wait and watch for awhile on Amazon (or check the used section), you can sometimes purchase this game brand new for about $20. At that price, it is well worth it. For my family, this has been a 4.5 to 5 star addition to our games selection. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I rated LEGO Minotaurus Game 5 stars because my son and husband loves to play it. The players are so tiny but they love the game and play with it monthly. Great purchase! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Very easy to play yet so much fun. The game is easy, but still get all the attention of my  8-year old. He loves it, and we will be getting more games by Lego. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This Lego game is more fun than expected.  Unlike Candyland and Chutes & Ladders where you roll the dice and move the corresponding spots with the occasional up or down the ladder, this game encourages more strategy and inventiveness.  Before starting the game, you need to build the maze (great for Lego-holics like my 7 year old).  This game allows up to 4 players although you can play with only 2 players.  You roll the die and advance by the number on the die (like most board games).  However, since it is a maze, you can go in many directions (my strategy was to use the shortest route and avoid the hedges and walls) to reach the Minotaur's Temple (guarded by the Minotaur).  When your die is on black, you can move the Minotaur to capture another player who will then would be moved back to his/her starting point, in essence eliminating the competition to get to the palce first.  (This obviously involve more thinking and strategy.)  If your die is on gray, you can move one wall to block your opponent(s).  Once your child has mastered these basic rules, you can then add more rules to the game by changing the faces of the die.  Maybe add a green face so anyone who gets a green can jump over a hedge to reach the destination sooner but watch out for the Minotaur and the moving walls!  Our whole family played (2 parents & kids ages 7 and 5).  Everyone had a great time eventhough my 5 year old took a bit longer to catch on.Now, this is their favorite game.  I highly recommend this game to everyone!  The amount of fun is well worth the price paid! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 5 year old son's introduction to Lego Games came in the form of Magikus, as it was less than half the price of Minotaurus, and it was aimed at a younger age group.  Suprisingly, we loved it almost as much as he did, and game play quickly became a nightly routine.  Therefore, it was evident that we needed to add to our collection, and the mythical Mintosaurus was next in line.  Little did we know that it would blow its formiddable predecessor away!  It offers greater strategic planning and a longer and more complex game play period.  Despite the 7+ age recommendation, my son has had no problems understanding the rules (after just a few days, we have even begun using the modified and more challenging rules), and he is quickly learning effective strategies.  Despite a toybox full of new and exciting toys from Santa, this is the first thing he asks for each morning and the last thing he asks for before bed, and, whenever possible, we are more than willing to oblige.  I have no reservations about whole-heartedly recommending this game as an alternative to the host of other brain-numbing kids' games out there.  This is one that kids, teenagers, parents, and grandparents can enjoy! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I have two sons, 5 1/2 and 8 and they both love this game.  They not only enjoyed putting the gameboard together they have really enjoyed playing it regularly.  The rules are very simple.  Basically you are trying to get your game piece(s) to the center.  You can also block you opponents with moving sections of wall.  If you roll the Minotaur, you can begin moving it toward your opponent and if you land on them, can send them back to start.  I will say that the pieces are a bit on the small size to handle but it doesn't make us enjoy the game any less. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a great game!  First, you put it together, then you play it!  There are a lot of options for play, so it is good for a variety of ages.  My 9-year-old LOVES it!  Good for creative and higher-order thinking.

If you really wanna adjust and tweak the various functions of the esc just connect the esc to the card and the card to a usb port on a computer via the supplied cable.  You will have to go to castle creations website and download the free software.  I actually had to download the software twice.  It worked better for me to download it right to my desktop and then install it from there for some reason.

Probably a must have for castle esc's...I don't have time to figure out all the beeps, blips, and various led colors that you would have to go through to program the esc with your controller.

Plug it into the throttle lead on the ESC, make your adjustments via the button on the Link, turn the ESC off, unplug the Link, and you're good to go with your new settings.One reviewer mentioned just borrowing one, and I would second that...especially if you're just someone that RCs for fun and doesn't really need to mess around with changing settings very often.

B002ZCXNQE,"[CLS] Fun but hard at the same time [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a very detailed puzzle. I would recommend this. It took some time to put together. But it looked very nice when it was finished. I would recommend this. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Loved this puzzle!We do many puzzles around here.This one is our current favorite.The pieces are high quality heavier weight than most other puzzles.One this this is not a puzzle for a young beginner they will get frustrated with how many pieces.This is more for either adults who love doing puzzles or kids with plenty of patience *)The colors really pop right off and the animals we love since they are more life like thanthe many kiddy puzzles we have sitting around the house.Originally we got this thinking we would glue it and frame for ds's room who loves elephants.We had so much fun putting it together that we have decided to keep it unglued and do it again.The pieces fit together well and did not fall apart when moving one section to another.we tend to break puzzles into sections and then fit them in as we go along.the size of this one kept us busier than normal which i also lovedusually we finish up a puzzle in two days this one was closer to 4 daysThis was our first Ravensburger but certainly not our last.I now know what it is like to have a decent beautiful puzzle and know why people get this brand.This is simply a piece of art. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is the biggest puzzle I have ever attempted - and it's a good one, well.  My two daughters (ages 13 and 22) were my main co-workers, and it's taken us a while, but we did it!  I'd say that all in all we probably averaged between 30-60 mins a day (combined time) working on this puzzle.We opened the box and poured out the pieces on 6 October.  By the end of that day we had found and assembled all but 2 or 3 edge pieces.  Then the REAL work began.  The short version is that we finished it tonight, 21 Dec - Whew! I'm sure glad the world didn't end before we could wrap this up!Here's how we did it.  Edges first - no mystery there for practiced puzzle assemblers.  Next we did the birds.  Their bright colors made them easy to work on.  As we did this we also pieced together the hippos, though it took quite a while before they were all the way done.  Next was the outline of the rhino - the first time through you will have a hard time telling the difference between rhino and elephant pieces, but overall, the rhino has more of a yellow hue, while the elephants are more gray. While this was going on we also stared to piece together the trees in the upper right-hand corner.  Then we tackled the giraffes and gazelles.The hardest part?  I'd say it was a toss-up between the big zebras and the elephants.  But probably because they were smaller, we finished the zebras before the elephants, and finding the odd piece here and there.My older daughter came up with the quote of the day as we prepared to take on the elephants in earnest.  She said,There comes a time in every puzzle when you have to buckle down and do the elephants.You just have to buckle down and do it.As for the puzzle itself...I found it to be well made.  The pieces fit together nicely.  There was a nice assortment of pieces, and it was a challenge to complete.At first we thought that we were one piece short, but we found it!  It was 8 months later, but still, we found it!So that's my experience with this puzzle.  Oh, one more thing...you need to make sure that you have a LOT of space for the puzzle and the pieces.  It took an entire ping pong table to accommodate the pieces when we did it.All in all, a very nice puzzle. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This thing is huge - make sure you pay attention to that!  It's not your average coffee table puzzle!  With that being said, I would recommend a mat you can keep it on to roll up between workings.  This thing is no joke!  I picked it because I thought all the different animals would provide lots of contrast, and so while time-consuming, not necessarily difficult.  While a good theory, the colors and definition weren't as sharp as I had hoped, so this is still proving to be a bit challenging.  I can't wait to see the entire puzzle come together - after a little over an hour last night, it's a border, a flamingo, and some birds. :-) [SEP]","[CLS] Ravensburger has been making toys for the hand, head, and heart for over 130 years.

A prey that stands its ground has a better chance for survival since wolves can chase their prey, reaching speeds of forty miles per hour with the help of their specialized paws and body structure. By marking their hunting territory, wolves are one step closer to ensuring their survival and their need for almost two tons of meat per year.

The first thing I note is that you have to take two covers off to put in batteries.  Remember this thing is designed to go into the water and it needs this so they are protected.  I just wasn't expecting this.  Once that is done you drive it like a tank.  Push both sticks forward and the car goes forward, both back and the car goes back.  I drove this on our carpet and it worked fine, went to the hardwood with fresh batteries and the thing spins all over the place.  Can't really control it at first and the kids had a tough time driving it on that surface.  It does however work in water so we took it out in the snow while I was shoveling the driveway and that worked well.  It gets stuck kind of easily because of the low ground clearance, but as a beginner RC it works great.  Only problem is that I don't think the kids like this as much as I did.  I got it because it looks cool and to drive in the snow, but I think they would rather play with something else.  Maybe when they are older they will come back to it, but for now it is just another toy in the box. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Got based on friend recommendation.

Usually Safari is our last choice for hard plastic animals, since their plastics are more plasticky, their modelling and paint work less accurate. But this high-quality Apatosaurus bucks the Safari trend, ranking right up there with Schleich and Papo. We especially like the delicate curve of the tail and the spacing between the legs. The big size means that it stands in nice, naturalistic (if not realistic) contrast to his smaller species of dino.

B0032W05OO,"[CLS] Ravensburger is the best puzzle brand we have found. The quality of their puzzles is always top notch. The pieces fit together nicely, the image is always bright and crisp, and the pieces don't bend or break apart like with some puzzles. All Ravensburger puzzle pieces are blue on the back, which is a nice touch, but sometimes makes it a bit more challenging to pick out blue pieces such as sky. They also come in a nice sturdy box.Another great feature of all Ravensburger puzzles is that they are packaged in a plastic bag (within the box) that is labeled with a batch number that you can use to try to get replacement pieces. We have never had a puzzle from them that was missing any pieces (and we have done around 20-30+ of their puzzles), but if you happen to end up with any missing pieces yourself, you should have the batch number available so you can contact Ravensburger's customer service (through their company website). I suggest that when you open up your puzzle, you write the number from the bag on the inside of your box. This way, you don't have to keep the bag around, and you will always have the appropriate batch number with each puzzle. Their current policy states that they are not always able to replace single pieces, but they will do their best to resolve the situation. Their manufacturing process requires they change the cutting tools every so many puzzles (and this process changes the shapes of the pieces), so my guess is that you will be able to get replacement pieces as long as your puzzle is from the current cutting tools.This particular puzzle was fun to do, because we could each pick out certain balloons or other areas to work on. Not the most challenging puzzle, but still fun. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I really love the quality of Ravensburger puzzles. Although this is 1000 pieces, I found it a little easier because the hot air balloons had such distinctive vibrant patterns (although the blue sky took longer).

He plays with it as much or more than she does and is currently trying to get her to play with him.  We'll see how that goes.  She is at the grabby, it's mine stage.  What is great about the toy is that there are two of each animal (of course!) and they can each play with one at the same time.The toy is so well made that I am sure that it will last for a long time.  It is also great for the kids to be able to act out the Bible story that they learn in Sunday School.  In the video that I will include, my grandson is saying, Wait for me, wait for me as he sends the animals up the ramp into the Ark.On top of it being such a quality toy, it is also cleverly made.  The animals store inside the Ark when not in play and there is a handle at the top which allows the children to pick it up and go without fuss or muss.  It also means that they can easily bring it to Nana and Papa's house and play with us, too. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Can't say enough how much I love Playmobil.

The animals in the ark are surprisingly good for stacking -- we've been playing circus and balancing the giraffes, zebras, and lions on the elephants' backs.  We also feed the animals quite a bit with the food bag and trough.  Unless I'm doing something wrong, the ark won't float in the bathtub, but most of the animals and people do.  With this set, I would warn you to watch out for the doves -- they are SHARP underfoot!Probably not all children will be quite as enthralled with the Playmobil 123 sets as mine, but I would recommend these for any toddler because:1. the people and animals make good security objects to take in the car2. the setting and characters are just right for all kinds of pretend play3. they're great for fine motor skills (standing them upright, getting them to sit, and even stacking some of them)4. they're fun and safe in the bathtub (and usually float!)5. you'd have to work pretty hard to get them stuffed in your mouth.

The video playback on the Barbie isn't what she had hoped for. It's a bit laggy and there is no audio playback on the Barbie.Then we downloaded some of the little movies she'd taken and, lemme just say, WOW. Our son got a spy watch for Christmas that takes video and the Barbie Video Girl video is better than the spy watch's video! And there IS audio when you play it back on your computer.PROS:- Easy to use - with three buttons, and one battery in the thigh (genius right there), it's quick and easy to use for young girls.- Cute! Just because Barbie's a video camera doesn't mean that she can't be cute! Her jacket and pants come off, but her top stays on.- Bendy - I personally love that she's got tons of joints and that she moves around very easily.- Great video and audio playback - again, when viewed on the Barbie screen the playback's not so good. Viewed on the computer, though, it's amazingly decent.- Free video editing software! Go to the website listed in the booklet and you can download video editing software, so your little Barbie lover can not only record, but can make their own Barbie movies.CONS:- Light - it does require quite a bit of light to get a great shot, but that doesn't mean that you have to invest in a spotlight. My daughter's bedroom light was perfect for taping. Try taping during daylight hours as well, with the overhead light on, and you'll get the best results.- The jacket - as much as I LOVE the jacket, you have to be careful. It can easily get in the way of the camera. Make sure it's moved out of the way before you start filming, or teach your daughter to hold the Barbie by the jacket, which will pull the fabric aside and will leave the camera free to tape.This is a great Barbie and it amazes me still how great the video and audio come out.

B00386QEG2,"[CLS] I got this for my son's 1st birthday and it was an instant hit, for he and his older brother (3 yrs).  Now, months later, it still gets fought over.  The toy has all sorts of appeal - as a wagon, as a block stacker, and as something to stuff other toys into.  It makes music and sounds that the kids love, but I love the off switch.  The blocks do have a tendency to go missing, like any other toy with accessories, but it can still be fun without them. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this for my 11 month old son, because I watch him play and is already stacking blocks and i thought this would be great for him. I am all about the wood toys because they are better quality but i think that sometimes toys that make noise are fun for children. Im not sure what i think or how much he likes it. Its bigger then i thought it would be. it seems to be durable. i guess i thought my son would really love it and he seems to think its only ok. the stackable figures might be better if they stayed up all the time. and they are a bit large for little hands. they have cute faces, but if they aren't stacked, you cant see them. it is not very noisy at all.(thank goodness) Even on high, the volume is very soft. the sounds are cute. very springy but in low pitch, which doesnt grate on your nerves. it doesnt annoyingly remind you every so often to keep playing, which is great. it only makes noise when its mouth is moved. its actually very cute. my son loves to push it around. thats about as much use as its gotten so far. i guess i just thought my son was going to love it more then he does, but it was only delivered yesterday. i will update at a later time, when i can get a better idea of how he feels about it. so far, im neutral on this. [SEP]"",""[CLS] As promised, I'm updating my review to five stars now that my son plays with this more often and for longer stretches.  The toy really does offer diverse play. Also, it's very durable!  At nine months, my little guy plays with this every day.  He loves to knock down the blocks.  He loves to wheel Mr Croc around the front room.  He loves to explore all his different functions (squeaks, sings, eats, eye rolls, etc). This toy has helped my boy develop and practice his fine motor skills.  Great purchase!  See my previous (baby @ 6month) review below.----------------------------------I set out to buy our 6 month old son a fun stacking toy for his Easter basket; I was planning on just a basic $10.00 toy.  We found this cute guy instead.  It was on a great sale and I just couldn't pass it up.  I'm really glad we got it, for just a little more $$ than other stackers . . . you get so much more toy.  The croc sings.  It rolls back and forth as my son pushes it, and I'm sure once he is walking he'll love pulling him around (the blue handle under his mouth comes out as a long pulling handle, thus wagon).  The eyes and mouth are fun and interactive.  And yes as everyone else says . . . Mr Croc is super cute.  I like that there are so many ways to stack the blocks. The handle under the croc (for pulling) has four little stacking areas (when pulled out it is easy for my 6 month old sitter to use this part as the stacker because it is lower to the ground than the croc body).  Oh, and few reviews point out that the tail stacker squeaks when pushed.  Fisher Price really seemed to get everything in there.  Great toy!There's only a couple tiny reasons I can't give this toy a full 5 star review.  The songs are short and don't seem to really play through.  Also, my son seems to be just as happy with other much simpler toys.  I'm just not really sure why he isn't falling in love with this toy.  Hopefully that will change as he grows and becomes more active.  And if it does I'll come back and modify the review to 5 stars. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This toy is so cute and will definitely grow with your little ones.  It has all the plusses that most kids like...sounds, different shapes, bright colors, interacts with your child.  The eyes spin, the mouth opens so your child can feed the croc blocks, then they can lift the center up to retrieve the blocks.  Also, the underside of the croc can be unfolded to make this a pull toy, and the croc makes even more sounds. Within the 1 month I have had this toy for my grandson to play with, he discovers something new each time.  When he comes over, this is one of the first toys he crawls to, and will sit and play with it for a long time.  I highly recommend it, and it doesn't take up that much room either, a big plus for any home with many baby toys!

Got that one replaced and it worked for a few months and then it too stopped recognizing the memory stick. 2 years later, it does not work at all. The other player still works, but also does not recognize the memory stick. I have to remove the memory stick, then put it back and restart. Then the other games show up, but they are jumbled. Meaning it will be the Disney Princess game with a Shrek icon on it. The Dora game shows Spongebob, etc. It's really a shame because if this system would've worked right, it would be a wonderful buy.

I haven't actually given it to my three-year-old yet because I'm saving it for a big plane trip, but I've fully tested it out and it is functional and durable, despite some negative reviews. I generally think this is a really good toy. I'm going to start having to limit screen time with this one because I'll bet my daughter will want to play with it too much. I have a few minor grumbles only. I wish it had a small keyboard. Everything with a keyboard on the market has stupid content. This has great content but no keyboard and my daughter wants something with a keyboard because she wants a computer. This doesn't look like a phone or i-pod, so there is no sense in pretending it is one. It would be better as a mini-child's laptop. Also, I wish it would speak the child's name the way the Leapster does. That one has much more limited content but it is very attractive to children thanks to its keyboard and voicing of the child's personalized name. A combo of those features in this would make for the super-ultimate preschool toy. Otherwise, it has great features. The mini-apps, which are downplayed in advertising, are among the best features actually. Don't be misled. Little kids can't do and don't care about the games. The like the drawing studio and music. They also love the piano mini app and the virtual pet and things like that. The free story that it comes with is about baseball and is really pretty stupid but I have yet to see a manufacturer who could get it threw their heads that they could use actually high quality children's stories with this. Say, hire a real author. Duh. But I digress. My kids don't even know what baseball is because we don't live in the US most of the time but I don't particularly care because I wanted it for the mp3 player, art studio, letter writing and photo book features and it has those and much more that will be great for my kids.

B00388J1UQ,"[CLS] (Updated 2013:  Please be aware that Rescue from Misty Island was one of several playsets Fisher-Price RE-released in 2013 withOUT the original heavyweight, superbly detailed train models they started out with.  The redesigned 2013 models' overall appearances were changed, and the differences were definitely noticeable in terms of facial and other detailing, wheels, etc.  What follows is my original review; you'd have to check with the vendor you're ordering from to determine if the set you'll be receiving is an actual original, or a 2013 re-release.)Based on the 2010 Misty Island Rescue movie, this playset - with one side being Misty Island (with a brown track) and the other side being Sodor (with a silver track) is a VERY elaborate Take-n-Play set, with FOUR separate places to connect up with other playsets or additional track!  Hard to begin to describe everything... the Sodor side has a few (painted on) buildings from the Sodor Search & Rescue Centre (you can see the tiny SSRC emblems) that is being constructed from the special Misty Island Jobi wood, and a lift of a lever opens a boarded up hidden passageway that Thomas (included!) can take into the Misty Island side, which has REALLY cool features!  Large Jobi trees are the backdrop to two ground level track loops, and another bending piece of track precariously towers above them!  There is also a swiveling logging crane with a knob to turn that allows the crane's big red (magnitized) hook to lift a couple of heavy (magnetized) Jobi logs up and out of the way for Thomas to explore all of the nooks and crannies in this set!  When Thomas is placed at the top of the set, another lever causes the Shake-Shake Bridge to actually SHAKE, which propels Thomas down a steep incline, where he bursts through a tunnel and back into Sodor!  It really is difficult to describe all of the intricate details included in this amazing set.  Rescue from Misty Island first appeared on the final 2010 Take-n-Play Collector Checklist, and we paid $34.99 for our grandson's.  (Update:  Fisher-Price's March 2015 MSRP for this playset is STILL listed at $40 - WELL worth it - one of our grandson's favorites!)  And just so you're aware, Take-n-Play products are not compatible with wooden tracks.JULY 2015 UPDATE:  The only thing I'd caution is that if you want a set your youngster can EASILY and QUICKLY take on the road with you, you might want to consider one of the $30 & under MSRP playsets instead.  Fisher-Price includes a new Collector Checklist in some (not all) Take-n-Play items each year, but they're only hawking the latest stuff.  If you have any interest in knowing which other $35 & over MSRP sets (which I've come to categorize as elaborate) have released since 2010, when Fisher-Price took over the Thomas diecast line from Learning Curve's Take-Along and renamed it Take-n-Play, here's a list for you (in order of introduction so you know what your options are:  Rescue from Misty Island, Rock Quarry Run, Load & Go, Rumbling Gold Mine Run, Thomas at Pirate's Cove, The Dieselworks, The Great Quarry Climb, Thomas at the Ironworks, Thomas' Adventure Castle, Slate Loading Station, Lion Canyon, Roaring Dino Run, Skarloey at the Wharf and Daring Dragon Drop... I wouldn't recommend them for easy transport though... those were the ones Grandma said had to stay put in our basement's family room (when a set comes with instructions, that's pretty much a clue to you that they're not easy for a 3 year old to close up to take-n-play with!), but the older sets are super if you plan to keep them set up at home!10/25/16 update:  I'm going back and adding this update to each of my Take-n-Play reviews, since it's important information for any parents/grandparents out there with a young Thomas & Friends enthusiast who holds a special place in their heart, and is considering beginning a collection for them.  I just found out the TnP line of diecast trains/vehicles/rolling stock with magnetic connectors is being REPLACED by Fisher-Price in 2017 with a diecast line called Thomas & Friends Adventures, which will be TnP models modified with PLASTIC HOOK & LOOP COUPLERS.  Obviously, your youngster will not be able to connect the 2014-2016 TnP models (with their flat, round 1-way magnetic connectors), nor the 2010-2014 TnP models - or Learning Curve's compatible 2002-2010 Take Along models - with their protruding 2-way magnetic connectors - with the new types of couplers as of next year.2/17/17 Update:  Fisher-Price must've received a slew of complaints from Take-n-Play owners, because they've now developed magnetic clip engine connectors (to clip onto the magnetic trains - but ONLY those with the flat round 1-way magnets... they don't want to invite comparisons between the high quality of the older trains with protruding 2-way magnets! - that have a plastic hook & loop coupler to be able to connect to the new Adventures engines), along with track adapter pieces (Take-n-Play track pieces/sets have only 1 male or female part at the end to connect up to other track/sets, while the new Adventures tracks/sets have both one male & 1 female part on EACH end), available by directly contacting F-P.

Well, he's 2, and he's tough on his toys and if he has a train running around on the bottom rail (figure 8) will knock the pole off. Also the stands that holds the curvy rails up is a little bit iffy.The one thing my son liked about this was that the top jiggles (it takes a little effort to set the shaking motion, but with a little help from mom, it works), and the jiggling pushes the cars onto the bridge and proceed to the decline down the curvy ramp and onward. The crane is interesting to him as well.Maybe we're spoiled and used to the other sets that have noises and talks. I think if this set made some sounds, it would keep him interested. The breakaway door is kitsch. The thing folds up really quickly and it's compact - I can see us travelling with it, but not portable enough to play on an airport or car (it's pretty big and fits up to half of our train table)...We love his other sets - talking knapford station, waterwall, train wash...really fun..this one, eh.

I couldn't stop smiling.There are 4 different types of Sing-A-Ma-Jigs: this pink bear, a blue dog, a red bear and a yellow bunny. They all make different sounds.  The yellow bunny and blue dog were my favorites but any of these Sing-A-Ma-Jigs are a great gift.  It makes funny variations of gibberish although I thought I heard some real words.  The mouth moves when it speaks.  When you stop pressing it's tummy, after a while you hear a see you later.This pink bear is adorable!

Their zany looks are unique to them, and when they sing you can't resist when their little mouths open wide for each note!

Also there is a lovely volume control, although I do not find the need to use it- the toy is relatively pleasant to listen to. We sing and dance to the music and drum alongto the beat.

B003A6EKX4,"[CLS] Okay, I'm an adult and I set this up for my granddaughters. I had some trouble doing so, but I'm sure if I had let them have the first go at it they would have succeeded first time around without reading the directions.Here are my thoughts on Harmony the Dancing Dog:I'll start with the cons:First the dog is tightly packaged in its box. You'll end up taking the bottom of the box apart and using scissors--so get them out!Secondly the directions are poorly organized due to the emphasis/pictures in my opinion. The dog is in try me mode with a button to switch it on located on his back. The sentence telling you this is the first thing on the sheet under Before you begin. Somehow I missed this and went directly to the illustration under it called Playing with your Pet. My fault of course.There is a table of play modes in the plugged in and unplugged states. It is written simply, but can be a bit confusing in that it states the dog will bark or sneeze depending on the number of nose touches both in plugged and unplugged mode. I'm not sure the dog sneezed or barked when plugged in.There is a very very small sentence that states the dog is not compatible with all MP3 players. I went to plug it in to my iPhone and realized rather quickly that this was not going to work...but it worked fine with the earphone outlet on the computer.The cord to connect the dog to the MP3 player is really really short. Probably not more than 8 inches in length. I connected it to my computer audio/ear phone jack and wanted to put it up on the computer box, but it was way to short.Harmony takes batteries which of course wear out!PROS:This is a fun toy for the kids. Especially smaller kids. The pink dog dances and moves to the music. The directions said she especially liked fast music. So I blasted several dance songs by Madonna from the computer and the dog followed along with them. The instructions stated she detects the beats and she did! She danced and lit up to Madonna's Vogue, Like a Prayer and more. I switched to Born in the USA by Springsteen and Harmony (the dog) had a little trouble with the beats as Bruce belts out the song in a staccato fashion--she recognized it was a bit difficult to dance to. I don't think Harmony liked Bruce's melodic beats that much, so we switched to the Beatles and once again she was dancing away.Harmony is very cute and you'll enjoy her as much as the kids! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Unfortunately, this is one of those toys that is fun for the first couple of songs you play on the computer.  After that, the dance moves are just the same old thing over and over, and the poor quality of the speaker begins to grate on your nerves.My dog arrived with the black from his eye having somehow been smudged all over its face.  The dog's one ear was also bent in a weird position upon arrival.I don't see it lasting long if it were to actually be used daily. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I wasn't sure what this thing did - or if was even worth it, but my niece really loves this thing!-My 6-year-old niece does listen to music in her room - she uses a CD player for the most part as she doesn't quite get the ipod-thing yet.  She also loves animals - stuffed, live, whatever.  She especially loves the kind of toy animals that emote or purr or make noises or seem real.  Although this thing looks cartoonish, the noises it makes are cute, and the lights and movements are fun to watch.-What this thing is, is a speaker for your ipod or cd player or whatever.  All you do is plug it into the audio output on your music device (small cable included) and this thing will act as a speaker, and move and light up and dance to the music.  It's kind of cute.  Oh you can also press the nose and it will bark or play a little tune or dance a little.  Little girls would like this thing.  I can see her showing her friends this puppy.  Sort of a short-lived entertainment item - because there's not much you can do with it other than plug it in and leave it there.  But, it is kinda cool. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This dog is cute and funny to watch for the first 5 minutes, and we cracked up as it danced to Led Zeppelin, but then it was irritating because the speaker is so bad.The colors and lights were interesting to my 7 month old, my friend's 3 year old played with it for about 15 minutes, and I think an 8 year old girl would dig it until she tried to use it as a speaker.  The package says for 8+ years old, so I didn't let my baby daughter chew on it or play with it without he holding it.  We have had it in the house for a few weeks and the baby is already bored with it.The song and action are suited to entertain a toddler, not a tween.  By the time a girl would have an MP3 player and care about music, she would be bothered by the horrible quality of sound coming out of this thing.If the speaker was better this would be MUCH cooler, I cannot recommend spending money on this.  Buy it only for children with parents you want to torture. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 6 y.o. loves this thing, but even she thinks the speaker is icky. Quite honestly, it's just unforgivingly tinny.Pros:1) Worked with both Sansa Clip, and various ipods (and iphone)2) Cute3) has an online feature, which ads interest4) Lights on head cute but limitedCons:1) Awful speaker2) Limited movement, dog makes noise over music3) Other similar products (<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/I-Dog-Dance-White/dp/B0013UAIDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>I-Dog Dance White</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Transformers-Movie-Beatmix-Bumblebee/dp/B000LDU2K4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Transformers Movie Beatmix Bumblebee</a>&nbsp;were MUCH better products.Bottom line: It's cute and has an immediate awe factor, but overall it was not as good a product as others out there. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I was excited to receive this item through the Vine program because my daughters, ages 4 and 2, love Littlest Pet Shop items and play with them a lot. They also love music and dancing. This dog is adorably cute and they fell in love with it at first sight. Unfortunately, when we hooked it up as directed to play music, the thing blasted sound at them so loudly they scattered in terror. My husband and I fiddled with it trying to find SOME way to control the volume, but if there is one, it certainly wasn't apparent to us. So we just took out the batteries and it's now just a plastic dog. A bit overpriced for that purpose, alas. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a gyrating dog/speaker that grooves to the music and has secrets codes. Tested this out on my cousin's kids (ages 9 and 10) since the product is recommended for ages 8 and up. The comments elicited were 'stupid' and 'lame'. They thought the LPSO website was 'babyish'. They didn't think the site was all that educational or informative and really didn't compare to the computer programs their folks buy them that are educational and fun. As for the music aspect, they both have mp3 players which they like a lot. In all fairness, my test audience was more advanced than most kids in their age group and they have an abundance of toys and educationally based programs that stimulate them.I also tried this out on my niece's 4 month old who really seemed to like it a lot. The flashing lights and sounds provided stimulation and kept her attention for a fairly long time.Facts: the sound quality is fair and constructed poorly. It doesn't work with all of the mp3 players in the house. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The recommended age on this is 8+ but my 3 Year old has plenty of fun with it. She does not have her own ipod so i just hook mine up to it and play disney music through it. she has been carrying it around for a few days now and has not gotten tired of it. i think it is super cute and is adequate for a small child to play music through. Small children do not need the best sounding speakers that can play so you can hear it throughout the house. This one you can hear in one room and i feel that is just enough. its easy to work and my daughter has no problems operating it. she loves the lights that sync with the speed of the music and throughout the song it will dance or bark every minute or so. Not often enough for it to be annoying. Overall i think that this is a really cool present for small kids who have access to an ipod and would like to listen to their favorite tunes without torturing the parents. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is defiantely a cute toy for a young girl with a music player.  When you press its noise it plays music, barks and dances.  Colors on its head light up as well.  It's easy to take the plug and plug it right into an ipod.  It's cute to watch dance as you play your music.  Can't really play with it, and there's no educational value.  It seems durab;e but we've only played with it for a day.  I only rated it a three because it needs a volume for its interactive play. [SEP]","[CLS] This is one pup that loves to get down.

B003AMOKS8,"[CLS] There are a lot of Batman video games. I own a bunch myself. From the NES version based on the Tim Burton movie all the way to the more recent Arkaham Asylum on PS3. Batman: The Brave and the Bold for the Wii is more of a throw back to the old beat em' up games on the Genesis, NES, & SNES.The first thing I liked were the graphics.  It looks exactly like the cartoon and gameplay is set up like an episode of the show. Definitely a great job on graphics. The controls were easy to get a hang of. A tutorial mode walks you through the all the moves and combos. Once you figure out how to fight and use your bat gadgets you'll find that you can play through the game almost effortlessly. In fact, I think the game is a little too easy. Not much of a challenge and I'm an average gamer at best.Bosses aren't that hard either, and like a lot of beat em' up games it can be repetitive at times. Mashing buttons through the streets of Gotham, killing everything in your path. Other Batman games like this would try to break up the monotony by adding a driving seqence with the Batmobile or flying in the Batplane but not in this game. I think it could have helped to even things out.It's all about collecting upgrades and different items like a sword, and of course batarangs. You can call in the help of other heroes like The Flash and Aquaman. Just pick which character you want before the level and they come in and clear all the enemies on the screen with there special. Reminds me of X-men on the Sega Genesis and it's cool to watch.There's some replay value. You can go back and get all the upgrades and different gadgets for Batman and play as the other characters the second time around. But with only 6 levels to play it ends up being a short game. With that said, all the elements of a good Batman game are here and I enjoyed playing it. Recommended highly for the Batman fans. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Awesome [SEP]"",""[CLS] Son loved it [SEP]"",""[CLS] This game gets an A+ for having a comic book/ cartoon feel. The music, though repetitive, is great throughout. Characters presented are DC's most popular except no Superman or Wonder Woman. But you fight along the relatives of the better characters like Green Lantern. You get the misfits from the show. I'm not a serious gamer so I'm not looking for throw-your-controller challenges that my 60 hour a week work self won't be able to live up to. However, with unlimited lives and re-spawns from any point in the game where you die coupled with infinite level by level saves leaves little challenge. You can play straight through with no practice so this games is probably best for a 9 year old. My 4 year old got bored of watching me play and could not do so himself. If you can get the game for 15 bucks as I did it's worth a try.The most annoying part is the mechanics of the fighting. You feel like you're pressing buttons and the character is fighting but you never really feel like the combos are unlimited or realistic, just canned pre-programmed combos and animations. Also, though you are encountering new opponents, they all are the same as the previous bad guys from other levels. A floating bomb guy is also another type of floating bomb guy.

B003AVNKVW,"[CLS] We bought this game along with Lego Magikus, and we were eager to play each.  Even though the games are both Lego products, they are quite different, so having played one doesn't make you feel like the second is just a rehash.The first time you play the game, you have the assemble the robot torsos and their body parts (heads, arms, legs).  The game contains two booklets, one with rules for play and the other with instructions on robot building, along with all of the pieces you'll need.  With my husband's help, my six-year-old put the little robots together.  It was a little complicated for her because some of the parts are very tiny and proved a bit of a challenge for her motor skills, but she enjoyed assembling the robots, as did we.  The robots themselves are very cute.Quite possibly my daughter's favorite part of the game is the customizable, changeable die.  She likes to take the pieces off and reassemble the die in a new pattern and, I have to admit, I'm pretty fascinated by this as well.  The game is for three players (although the rule book notes that you can use your own Lego pieces to assemble a yellow robot and expand the gameplay to a fourth person), and each one selects a torso to begin the game.  Taking turns rolling the die, you pick up various parts for your or another player's robots, swap the parts, etc.  Whoever gets all of the parts of their robot first can assemble their robot and become the Robo Champ, complete with a Lego-style trophy for your robot to hold.One of the big selling points of these games, though, is that they are customizable.  The rule book contains suggested alternate rules for play and encourages you to come up with rules of your own and even post them online for others to see.  I like the idea that the game encourages some out-of-the-box thinking, and that it really makes the game each child's own.  Gameplay is also quick, so this is an ideal game for when you don't have a lot of time.  We really love this product and are eager to buy more Lego games.

B003AVNKWQ,"[CLS] My daughter and I first spotted the Lego games in our local Target a while back.  Ever since, I've been eager to get one, so we waited for this game with great anticipation.  I'm very happy to say that it does not disappoint.Like books, games for children can be pretty taxing and less than thrilling for adults.  I shudder to think of my daughter's Chutes and Ladders days.  I'm always a little worried when we get a new game, because I want it to be a fun experience for the whole family, and that's exactly what Magikus is.  When you first open the box, it contains a rule book for the game and an instruction book for assembling the game board, plus all of the little Lego pieces you'll need for the assembly (and a couple extra).  My husband has loved Legos ever since he was a kid, so he loved putting the game set together.  It was a nice activity for him and my daughter.  The assembly isn't all that complicated, but she's six, and I'm not sure it was something she could have handled on her own.  At any rate, putting the game together is part of the fun of the experience.Once the game is assembled, play can begin.  The object is to get the four components you need in order to create the spell and win the game.  Gameplay is fast-paced and this is a quick game, which makes it nice for squeezing a quick session in before or after dinner.  My daughter really likes the customizable die, and has fun taking it apart and putting it back together in a new configuration.  The die makes me marvel at Lego's ability to come up with fun, innovative products.We began with the basic rule set and then expanded into other rule sets as we got a hang of the game.  Changing the rules up helps keep the game fresh and just makes the product even more fun.  Our current favorite is the secret spell alternate rule.  The next step will be to try to cook up our own rules for the game.  This is a really fun product that I would highly recommend. [SEP]"",""[CLS] LEGO Magikus is a parts-collecting game based mostly on random rolls of a die. It's a cute little package, and considering it can be gotten fairly cheap, it's hard to argue against.You set up an ingredient rack by following the build instructions. The goal is to collect four specific ingredients, and then cast the magic spell by placing all the ingredients into a black cauldron piece. The cauldron seems like a pretty after-the-fact addition as you've already won when you collect all your ingredients, but hey the kids will probably love that part. So, there are four each of four ingredients on the rack. You need to collect one of each ingredient to win. The six-sided die has a color to correspond to each ingredient (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow), so you basically just roll the die and take the appropriate ingredient from the rack (assuming there are any left). Each player also has their own scoring rack (ingredient list), with four colored places to put ingredients and keep track of what you need to collect. Fill up your ingredient list, and you win.There are two twists to this. At the beginning of your turn, you may move the white owl piece to a spot outside any row or column of ingredients. If you roll white on the die, you make take any ingredient from the row or column you've placed the owl on- if you forgot to move the owl, you have to choose from where it is. If you instead roll black on the die, you may take one ingredient from another player- this is especially useful later in the game when other players may have taken all of a specific ingredient off the rack. This completed the die (White, Black, Red, Green, Blue, Yellow).The game also comes with optional rules, including a black bat piece that I'd recommend including as soon as players are comfortable with the base game. The bat piece can be used as a fifth ingredient, so now when you roll black on the die you may choose to either steal an ingredient from another player, or take the bat (including stealing the bat from other players). This adds a decent kick of strategy, as players have to decide between hoping to roll ingredients they need and taking the bat early, or building ingredients and going for the bat at the last minute. There are also rules for mixing up the ingredient lists, including the extra pieces necessary to make room for variations, complete with a suggestion to keep your ingredient list secret during play. Players then vie to fill their own secret shopping list, and there's some fun guessing what pieces other players need as the the game progresses.Overall, this is a cute little game. It's mostly for young kids, but adults won't feel completely left out as there is some strategy and bluffing with the advanced rules. The gameplay would work for children younger than the 6+ recommendation, but the game does contain a number of small parts that pose a choking hazard, so be careful letting very young players near this one. Adults may also need to help small children, as the rack setup is rather delicate and requires some dexterity to pull ingredients off without disturbing other pieces. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Our kids (ages 10 and 7) really liked this one. It's fun and fast, very easy to learn and set up, and even a year later they still want to play! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I was excited when I saw this.  I was unaware that Lego was making games (yes I'm very out of the loop).  This is definitely geared toward kids but I enjoyed playing it with my nephew.  The basic game is mostly luck of the draw but when you start trying the different variations there gets to be much more strategy.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes Lego games or is interested in magic. [SEP]",[CLS] Be the first to cast the magic spell in the cauldron!

Lego's are truly a toy for all ages and this Toy Story Train is no exception!  Great, great product! [SEP]"",""[CLS] **Update December 2011: Lego has delisted this set. There are, as of writing, still supplies of this train available. At some point, prices for the set will start to appreciate quickly.**This is a five star train for kids in the 5 to 8 year old range.  Older kids may be more interested in the City line trains (7938 and 7939) or the Harry Potter Hogwart's Express train (4841).  The City trains, incidentally, are the only ones that come as complete sets with track, motors and remote control devices.Wow, this is a good looking train!  I believe that the photos and box art for the set don't do justice to how it looks when it is built, and how much fun it is to play with.  This is an Old West 4-4-0 steam engine, box car, passenger car, and caboose. I would describe the design as more cartoon-like than realistic, with the engine having exaggerated proportions and the cars a tad short. The set includes no track or motor. It is designed as a push train. The engine uses four new drivers (and comes with two extra un-flanged drivers) as well as a cattle-catcher (a new part). The train cars themselves are short but attractively designed.  As with the other new trains for 2010, this set is largely brick-built (i.e., few specialized plastic moldings). The set includes Woody, Buzz, Jessie, Bullseye, Rex, and Evil Doctor Pork Chops mini-figures. The passenger car and the caboose are designed with lift-off tops to make it easier to place characters inside, and the box car has a trap door in the roof.  The caboose and the passenger car also have doors at each end, but these are hard to close unless you lift off the top.  And I find that the engine is not as sturdy as I would like (e.g., the piston cylinders can pivot out of the proper orientation, the cattle catcher comes off when the kids hit objects -- as they are won't to do).  The train is not a difficult build, but younger children will likely need some assistance.Regarding adding a motor, it is possible to use Lego's Power Function (PF) accessories to add one.  The easiest way is power the drivers with a motor, place an IR receiver in the engine cab, and a battery in the box car.  The problem with this method is that the drivers are large and so even at slow motor speeds, the train goes faster than it should.  It is preferable, but more of a hastle, to build a tender and put both the motor and battery box in it.  This engine deserves a tender, and a tender's wheels are a more appropriate size for the motor.  Wheels, coupling magnets and bricks can be had, piece-by-piece, directly from Lego.  Obviously, motorization is really a project for tinkerers, but isn't that what Lego is about?  In any case, the major parts that you need are (usually directly from Lego): 88002 (motor), 8884 (IR receiver), 8879 (IR transmitter), and one of the following:-8878 (rechargeable battery) with 8887 (transformer for recharging)-88000 (AAA battery box).Though train buffs will likely be put-off by the design, this set is going to be very, very popular among children.  Grandparents, I think this makes a perfect birthday or holiday gift.  I do recommend buying track; the engine's wheels are on two bogies, so the whole thing can get a little sideways without it.  As of early 2011, Lego discontinued their standard track pack, #7896. Two such sets gave you an oval. 7896 is still available but often at outrageous prices. In place of 7896, Lego currently offers a flex-track pack (#8867, which is enough to make a circle) and a combination straight and flex pack (#7499). I don't believe the flex track is ideal for curves, but it is not clear what Lego's plan is at the moment. There are also switches available (set #7895).  If you want to add additional old west structures, you can add 7594, Woody's Roundup (which is a scene in Toy Story 2, not 3). [SEP]"",""[CLS] **Lego delisted this set in 2011.

As of early 2011, Lego discontinued their standard track pack, #7896. Two such sets gave you an oval. 7896 is still available but often at outrageous prices. In place of 7896, Lego currently offers a flex-track pack (#8867, which is enough to make a circle) and a combination straight and flex pack (#7499). I don't believe the flex track is ideal for curves, but it is not clear what Lego's plan is at the moment. There are also switches available (set #7895). If you want to add additional old west structures, you can add 7594, Woody's Roundup (which is a scene in Toy Story 2, not 3). [SEP]"",""[CLS] **Lego delisted this set in 2011. The main secondary market for older Lego sets is Bricklink.com, so check there as well. To see which Lego trains are currently available or forthcoming, click through my name to my guide on Lego trains (go to the Guide tab).**I am the nut-job parent that you'll see in some of the other train reviews. I grew up with Lego and returned to it when I had kids. Obviously I am terribly partial to Lego, but I'll give you the best review I can so that you can make the decision that is right for your kids. I do not receive free sets or compensation for my Lego reviews.This is a five star train for kids in the 5 to 8 year old range. Older kids may be more interested in the City line trains (see my guide) The City trains, incidentally, are the only ones that come as complete sets with track, motors and remote control devices.Wow, this is a good looking train! I believe that the photos and box art for the set don't do justice to how it looks when it is built, and how much fun it is to play with. This is an Old West 4-4-0 steam engine, box car, passenger car, and caboose. I would describe the design as more cartoon-like than realistic, with the engine having exaggerated proportions and the cars a tad short. The set includes no track or motor. It is designed as a push train. The engine uses four new drivers (and comes with two extra un-flanged drivers) as well as a cattle-catcher (a new part). The train cars themselves are short but attractively designed. As with the other new trains for 2010, this set is largely brick-built (i.e., few specialized plastic moldings). The set includes Woody, Buzz, Jessie, Bullseye, Rex, and Evil Doctor Pork Chops mini-figures. The passenger car and the caboose are designed with lift-off tops to make it easier to place characters inside, and the box car has a trap door in the roof. The caboose and the passenger car also have doors at each end, but these are hard to close unless you lift off the top. And I find that the engine is not as sturdy as I would like (e.g., the piston cylinders can pivot out of the proper orientation, the cattle catcher comes off when the kids hit objects -- as they are won't to do). The train is not a difficult build, but younger children will likely need some assistance.Regarding adding a motor, it is possible to use Lego's Power Function (PF) accessories to add one. The easiest way is power the drivers with a motor, place an IR receiver in the engine cab, and a battery in the box car. The problem with this method is that the drivers are large and so even at slow motor speeds, the train goes faster than it should. It is preferable, but more of a hastle, to build a tender and put both the motor and battery box in it. This engine deserves a tender, and a tender's wheels are a more appropriate size for the motor. Wheels, coupling magnets and bricks can be had, piece-by-piece, directly from Lego. Obviously, motorization is really a project for tinkerers, but isn't that what Lego is about?

This was fun to build and he could play with it after he has finished building it. He loves the minifigures that came with such as Bullseye, Rex and Evil Dr. Porkchop with his black hat. There are magnets which connects them together and the doors open. It looks very nice after it was completed.

I ended up putting it together I was frustrated that no matter how gently my son played with it he was constantly yelling for me to come put the engine back together! It seemed every few minutes I was having to get back out the directions to put it back together. I ended up putting super glue on most of the engine parts. Toy Story is one of our favorite Pixar movies so having this set is pretty neat. I am not one to keep things as collectors do in boxes unopened however I do have most of the Lego Toy Story set put together and on display in my china cabinet. This set is one of the better ones, I am impressed with the details on it, definitely glad we purchased it. I would recommend it to friends & I would purchase it again. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We have put this together for awhile now. It was fun to put together. I was amazed that my son new a lot more about legos then I thought. He put it together and loved playing with it, He said he did not want to take it apart he wanted to leave it as a train. He loves it. The little figures was fun. He added some of his other lego figures and had so much fun. Overall a great train by lego. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 5-year-old is a huge train, LEGO AND Toy Story fan, so needless to say, it was an instant winner. I have never purchased one of these expensive LEGO sets and I had always been intrigued but refused to pay the high price tags despite the begging every time we see them in the store. I was very pleasantly surprised. This set is obviously not made for 5-year-olds, so I did most of the building though he was able to put quite a few parts together on his own. It took us about 2 hours to complete, whew! When it was done, I was afraid it would be very fragile and that he'd have to use caution when playing with it or it would fall apart. Not so! I can't believe how well it stays together during play along with Thomas and the Chuggington game at play time. I did remove a handful of the smaller pieces that stuck off the engine and were prone to falling off if bumped, but other than that, he has been having so much fun with this. The quality is really fantastic. The characters are more detailed than what I expected from a LEGO set and he has a great time sticking them all over the train in different poses and playing out his own stories. We may just have to get a few more sets as he gets older. Lots of fun for both of us! [SEP]",[CLS] Pieces: 584 [SEP],https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BUNaA-sfL.jpg
B003DVWM22,"[CLS] Gift [SEP]"",""[CLS] My three granddaughters (ages 2,4,6) really enjoy this tent.  It sets up quickly, packs up compactly, and is great fun in service. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We got this as a gift from a friend.  Our two girls have had fun camping out in it, and having a little fort full of all their dolls and stuffed animals.  It's been used for hide & seek, too.  It's not set up all the time, and we've gotten plenty of use out of it over the past few years.  Unfortunately, one of the rods broke (splintered long-ways), so it doesn't hold up so well.  I haven't had any luck finding mention of a replacement, but haven't given up yet.  If I can get that replaced, I think it will be a nice toy for some time to come. [SEP]"",""[CLS] It is NOT worth what it sells for!!! I wish I'd read the reviews before making the purchase - however a relative really wanted to get it for our daughter & we didn't want to disappoint her, nor do we want to return in & break her heart, so we're stuck with it. It was super easy to put together, so I don't know why some of the reviews say it was hard. HOWEVER - it is SUPER flimsy, and the tunnel isn't worth attaching at all because (though in the picture it looks like a snug fit) it just dangles there by the loops as previously stated, and is a lot smaller than the opening its intended to cover. Also - the face door flap hangs by the same kind of loops & leaves a big gap as well, and just falls off if you look at it. VERY disappointed!

B003DZ35GK,"[CLS] A very easy plane to fly, would highly recommend this plane to all beginners. [SEP]"",""[CLS] First time a flew it and it hit the ground. That was the end of that. If you take your time and learn to fly it you might be able to make it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is probably my most favorite airplane.  It is tough but agile.  I can fly it in a huge field, or in a back yard.  It has just the right speed to be slow enough to be able to fly anywhere, but still fast enough to be interesting.  I can fly this at my son's soccer practice and can fly amongst people, goal posts, basketball goals, etc.  This is my go to airplane for this type of environment.  Despite having no ailerons you can perform incredibly accurate flight maneuvers.This is probably the best airplane one can get for training.  And unlike most trainers, this one is still fun to fly even after you have moved on to bigger aircraft.  And it is very tough.  I have only broken it once and that was easily fixed with glue.If you like to fly, or think you want to learn to fly, this airplane should be in your hangar.I usually fly with batteries that are larger than the stock battery.  I like to fly with a 250 milliamp hour battery that I just hold in place with a rubber band.  This doubles flight time to around 20 minutes or so. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Its foam and doesnt last as long as I thought it would. It did fly great though while it lasted and we did get some good fun out of it. Just wish it would have lasted alittle longer though. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I have built many RC Planes in my life. Balsa wood was the only available kind back then. After spending months and months building and trying to learn to fly and crashing and watching Money and time and effort be destroyed in seconds I stopped trying. I was a kid then, now over 50++ I always wanted and dreamed to fly RC planes. I still own many planes and have flown none.After wanting ti get back into the Dream, I purchased a Champ and a Super Cub . I have flown the Champ many times and my plan is to learn on the Champ and then move to the Cub.This remarkable little plane is a wonder to fly. It takes very little effort and it flies like a dream. It will go so slow you can actually walk faster then it moves and for something so small, this little Champ can fly fast and cover allot of space in a hurry.This plane is great for anyone who wants to learn to fly RC planes, in fact my recommendation for ones first plane. yes it is small and made of foam. The new technology of today's RC has surprised me . In my day the motors alone weighed several pounds . The first planes I fly were rubber band power,and  yes they still make them and even better.I have boxes of balsa wood planes I love putting them together and many take months and some years to do. This Champ comes complete in the box and is ready to fly as fast as you can charge the battery, which btw comes with the Champ and the charger is included. I recommend you buy extra batteries because you will not want to stop flying once you get started.here is how the flights have gone. The weather has been rotten to say the least. I have been getting impatient. I tried flying the Champ in my yard which is reasonable sized. The first flight because of wind gusts put me in a tree....after awhile i finally got it out, no damage was sustained at all.Next flight I was at a local park and it was a beautiful sunny day and some wind and would occasionally gust really hard. This Champ handled it in the wider space with no issues. At one time the wind had it standing perfectly still for over a minute, it looked like a stop motion scene in a movie.The Champ can fly really slow and is how you really want to fly it, but it can also fly very fast for it's size, The Power this little plane produces is amazing for something so small. Now about the plane, the motor is smaller than most people's pinky finger...the servos that run Rudder and elevator are unique , not normal servos. In my life I have never seen any like this others may have. But they do what they are designed to do very well. the battery is held in with velcro which does an excellent job . The Transmitter and battery and charger all come with the package.I have read where many say the plane will not handle wind....I had it in wind gusts around 10 mph it flew very well...I read where many complain cause it climbs, that is it's high wing design . When turning into the wind it will climb and it can get very high and can get blown away from you, the power of the motor will amaze you if you when you turn to face the winds, use down elevator and throttle up , it will fly perfectly level....and when turning to move back downwind, just ease power back and make the turn and the Champ will fly really fast as the wind pushes it along...one can even let throttle all the way off. when turning downwind and back into the wind...give it a little throttle and elevator Up as you make the turn and as it begins to lift in the wind throttle up again and elevator down and she will level out and push through the wind.Cross winds will buffet the little plane, but I have had no issues with it flying in wind. One day it gusted really bad, must have been 15-20 mph, the plane would not fly in that much wind...it struggled way to much and was really hard to handle...but if in a open space you can play with crosswinds and downwind and make some headway...but any struggle will reduce the battery time and flight times will be far less.On a perfectly calm day or winds less than 5 mph, you can get this plane to do almost anything....and i see one person stated it will not do loops, it will do loops with no problems...again use the wind to your advantage...as you learn to fly you will learn what the Champ will do and what it will not do. You will know in what situations makes this plane better and what situation you won't to avoid.I have crashed this little plane several times just trying to overfly it. From ducking under tree limbs to going under wires . It has sustained no damage. I have nose dived it many times which seems to be the majority of mishaps most people experience with these little planes. It can take a beating and keep flying. I would recommend a grassy area and not a parking lot, because of the foam design the asphalt or concrete can be destructive to these planes.I leave my landing gear on, but in the grass it will nose over every time. If one just ensures their throttle is off it does no harm to the plane at all.The landing gear just pops off and you can belly land it, which is probably the best thing to do, I leave mine on simply because I love how it looks when it is going by me at less than 1 mph.....it's like watching a show....this plane is remarkable and I do recommend it for everyone, Both young and old and the beginner and the intermediate to even the highly experienced , I believe will get a joy in flying this little Champ.And this is not just for boys, girls can learn to fly to , in fact I recommend a family make it a family outing....these planes with the new technology can be flown many at one time. The system is designed to withstand any outside interference . Once you turn on the transmitter and then hook up the battery that plane and that transmitter are connected and it will not lose it's signal no matter what else is flying. You can fly as many as you care to at once...I believe families would enjoy that outing.All I can say is buy one you will not be disappointed...in fact it will bring a smile to your face....and a few laughs in the process....ENJOY this Little  CHAMP !! [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is an awesome little plane. It flies smooth with lots of power. First flight for me was a little jerky until I just trimmed it a little and it would just fly itself. Just a little up or down and left or right is smooth. It flies nothing like my big plane which is much harder to control. You can crash it and hardly no damage happens. I put some more clear tape around the wing edges to protect from chipping. I also put some stiffer tape where the wheel flanges meet the body of the plane to keep gouge marks from digging in from the metal strip on the landing gear.  I bought some extra batteries and now will always have one ready. Parts are available thru Amazon. I'm hoping this will help me get better control of my bigger plane because the controls on the transmitter are set the same. I would not hesitate to buy another when this one is beyond repair.Last evening the air was cool and no wind. It flew great and no loss of signal. I'm sure to have a lot of fun with this one. One more thing to mention is the manual is very well written and easy to understand.UPDATE:Mar. 29---- I have let this little plane stretch it's wings in a large open ball field. Just super--- even with some wind that would almost make it stand still in the air! Really got the hang of it now. It's much easier in a bigger space to fly.I added a penny with some velcro for easy removal. I put it in the center of the windshield and I also bought some blinkies and put velcro on the bottom of each one. Swap the blinkie for the penny when you want lights. There are four to a pack with different colors and bright flashing lights. It flies with much more speed and does not lope. Great help to smoothing out the flight.Tip1:If you set you rudder a tiny bit off center and your elevator level to a tiny bit up the plane will fly itself in a large circle. If you are doing the control and feel it's about to crash just release all except the throttle and it should recover. Remember speed is controlled by the elevator not just the throttle.Tip2:Add some clear tape to the elevator and rudder--you will need it sooner or later. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Valentine's Day is my one chance per year to make up for all the stupid, lazy, thoughtless, horny, arrogant and unromantic things my wife has put up with since the last V-Day. My only hope to get out of the doghouse and back in the bunkhouse is to pull off a Grand Romantic Gesture that makes her forget the Neanderthal she lives with for 364 days in between.Also, I don't want to spend too much money. Some of that stupid, lazy, thoughtless stuff can get pretty expensive. So it's a real challenge.One of the most romantic things I can think of would be to write a love message to my wife in the sky. But I can't afford an actual skywriter, so I figured this RC plane would have to do. At least I could 'sky'-write a message to my sweetie in our living room. The whole world might not see it, but at least the dog would be entertained.I bought this plane and spent a few days getting my loop-de-loops and barrel rolls down until I was pretty good with it. The controls were pretty intuitive, and the plane very responsive and maneuverable; just what I was looking for.Sadly, it was then that I found out there's no 'smoke canister' attachment sold for this model. I wasn't sure if I could still use it, until I got the bright idea to light a little ball of paper and attach it to the tail. I couldn't turn the smoke off, but at least I could profess my love in aerial cursive. How romantic is that?Of course, futzing with the tail fin threw the controls out of whack a little. On my first trial run, I lost altitude coming out of a spin and the plane careened into the drapes. Which caught on fire, naturally. And singed the magazine rack next to the window, and pretty much reduced the plane to a charred melted heap of nothing. I had a little dust bunny Hindenburg, right there in my living room.So now I'm getting the missus new drapes for Valentine's Day. And I've agreed not to try operating aircraft, remote controls or fire for the foreseeable future. Not as 'romantic' as I might have liked, perhaps, but it seems like a fair trade. [SEP]"",""[CLS] As long as you have sufficient altitude, the Champ recovers gently and controllably from stalls.  It is sturdier than it looks, and the fact that it weighs less than 2 ounces helps minimize the damage from accidents.  (Just don't fly it full speed into a hard surface.)  Extra batteries are inexpensive, as are the readily available replacement parts.  It shouldn't be flow on a windy day, but neither should most of the bigger planes.  Lots of fun in a small package.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] These die cast vehicles are really nice and my grandson loved them [SEP]"",""[CLS] I got these for my son (who is far from the recommended age range).  He loves them.The quality of these is very impressive given their price.  They roll wonderfully - the pull back action is great & feels very sturdy.  These have endured quite a bit of abuse at the hands of my son - who likes to drive things off the edge of our bay window seat - so numerous 2' tumbles for each of these.  It seems like you'd have to work pretty hard to snap off one of the doors.  He hasn't messed with the interior bits (like the steering wheel) but they seem pretty sturdy too.  None of them have any alignment issues - they all roll pretty straight & the pull back action is pretty strong - it will go quite a ways on a hardwood floor.Mine also endured a very rough shipping situation.  Normally Amazon is pretty good with their packaging, but of course everyone makes mistakes & these experienced one of those.  These do not come in their own packaged box - I think whoever sells them has repackaged them from bulk sets, so instead they're wrapped in shipping paper & put into a poly envelope, staggered (so the top of one truck is in the truck bed of the other one). Normally this would be just fine - it's enough protection to withstand the shipping journey, unless of course it's packaged in a 3' x 4' box along with a 35lb bag of dog food, which was the case for me (the dog food is part of my subscribe & safe, wasn't part of this order).  I would have returned them immediately, but my son had already seen them & he's too young to understand that, so I just let him have them.  Thankfully Amazon was really understanding & gave me a credit for future use.It seems the only possible sort of damage from that is the truck beds are ever so slightly bent away from the cab, which I think is pretty impressive for these to have withstood that so well (since I watched the UPS guy bring that big box up - it was a bit rough, understandably so given the awkward weight & size).Great product, great quality & a very good price.FYI - I also spotted cars like this (about the same size, pull back action & opening doors & whatnot) at a Kroger in the Atlanta area.  They were $5.99 (+ tax) - but I admit, none of them were as cool as this design (more modern cars & sports cars).  I got one there - a VW Beetle design - seems to be comparable to these in terms of quality & design.  Just thought I'd mention that in case you have a kroger near by (unfortunately I've never seen them in the publix stores in my area).  UPDATE  - the kroger bought VW is definitely not the same quality...both bumpers have already fallen off :( these on the other hand barely even have scratches..so well worth it.

But the spoiler is held to the car by only one small piece with just two holes to secure it, and nothing on top of that to help hold it in place like everything else on the car.  So while it can pivot, and change it's angle in relation to the ground, it just does not stay put well at all during play.Other than that, the rest of it is your normal lego set experience, and the Buzz and Woody characters are fun to have now.Rocket is designed as if it has a booster stage, so the lower portion can come off easily.  And where it connects to Buzz's back, it will pivot, so has a tendency to spin around during play as well.

We paid $10.99 for our oldest grandson's when we started a Thomas diecast collection for him that year, which coincidentally was the same year Fisher-Price had just taken over the diecast line from Learning Curve's Take-Along.  (Fisher-Price lists a $12 MSRP as of March 2015.)We think the coolest thing about the talking engines released in 2010 (Thomas, Percy, James, Gordon, Spencer, Rosie, Henry, Edward, Diesel, Toby) and 2011 (Emily, Percy at the Dieselworks, and the Thomas & Percy included in a 4 pack called Talking Thomas & Percy Hard at Work) was that as soon as our grandson would start moving his engines along the track - withOUT having to press the button on top! - there was the neatest chka-chka-chka chugging sound, and the lights automatically came on!  (You only had to press the button down to hear the actual phrases.  One of our grandson's favorite things to do (pretty much on a daily basis!) was to line up all of his talkies, dim the lights in our family room, and enjoy the special effects as all of his lit engines chugged in unison!  A few 2011 talking models didn't chug, but that was because they wouldn't in real life (fire engine Flynn, Sir Topham Hatt's Musical Caboose and Troublesome Trucks... the last two items didn't light either, but again, they wouldn't in real life so it made sense.)In 2012, Fisher-Price started cutting costs a bit by eliminating our favorite feature from the talking models (Salty, Diesel 10 and Charlie)... they no longer chugged or lit up automatically when you moved them along the track!  We actually hadn't even realized it until someone pointed it out, since when all of our grandson's engines were chugging it wasn't noticeable that some weren't.  We were REALLY disappointed about that.  It then appeared they were eliminating the automatic chugging/lighting up features from new production of the older models!  That was truly a shame, since not only did the chugging sound add to their charm, but F-P also raised the MSRPs at the same time... a double whammie!  (And just so you're aware, Take-n-Play products are not compatible with wooden tracks.)We kept our collection going for one more year, adding 2013's talkies (Paxton, Belle, Flynn to the Rescue and James with Castle Crest), but by the end of the year we'd seen so many other signs of deterioration in the line (heavier use of plastic rather than diecast, flimsier playsets, etc., cheaper packaging) that we felt it was no longer a collection-worthy line of products and stopped - that's not only a shame for us (we've had two more grandsons since then for whom we would've loved to keep the collection going!), but we also think it says a lot about Fisher-Price... you can't reduce product quality so drastically and expect people to keep coming back for more.We were sad not to add 2014's talkies (Hiro, Ferdinand, Winston, Den and Stephen)... our middle grandson turns 3 this month and hasn't shown much interest in his brother's trains other than the talkies, so I don't know... we may eventually get those five even though our favorite feature no longer exists.  But 2015's are even worse, severely plasticized and stripped of detailing... new versions of Thomas, Toby, Salty, Percy, Diesel, Spencer, Diesel 10, Henry, James, Gordon and Emily (you can tell the new versions by their flat round magnet connectors, versus the protruding ones on the older models.)  If you can find the ORIGINAL versions, I'd definitely skip the new ones!10/25/16 update:  I'm going back and adding this update to each of my Take-n-Play reviews, since it's important information for any parents/grandparents out there with a young Thomas & Friends enthusiast who holds a special place in their heart, and is considering beginning a collection for them.  I just found out the TnP line of diecast trains/vehicles/rolling stock with magnetic connectors is being REPLACED by Fisher-Price in 2017 with a diecast line called Thomas & Friends Adventures, which will be TnP models modified with PLASTIC HOOK & LOOP COUPLERS.  Obviously, your youngster will not be able to connect the 2014-2016 TnP models (with their flat, round 1-way magnetic connectors), nor the 2010-2014 TnP models - or Learning Curve's compatible 2002-2010 Take Along models - with their protruding 2-way magnetic connectors - with the new types of couplers as of next year.2/17/17 Update:  Fisher-Price must've received a slew of complaints from Take-n-Play owners, because they've now developed magnetic clip engine connectors (to clip onto the magnetic trains - but ONLY those with the flat round 1-way magnets... they don't want to invite comparisons between the high quality of the older trains with protruding 2-way magnets! - that have a plastic hook & loop coupler to be able to connect to the new Adventures engines), along with track adapter pieces (Take-n-Play track pieces/sets have only 1 male or female part at the end to connect up to other track/sets, while the new Adventures tracks/sets have both one male & 1 female part on EACH end), available by directly contacting F-P.

B003FZAADY,"[CLS] Our two daughters ages 2 and 4 love this Barbie doll.  Our 2 yr old got it from Santa for Christmas and they both have enjoyed playing with it.  We showed them how it works and there are no problems.  Our 4 yr old can switch her dresses back and forth with minimum assistance.  I have to agree...there should have been more explanation about how the doll worked and how her dresses were part of her permanently displayed on the outside of the box.  Some children could be very disappointed if they cannot change her dresses with other Barbie dresses.  Fortunately our girls are pretty good about accepting this fact about her. [SEP]"",""[CLS] First week this was out it was on my daughter's wish list and was received as a gift - in intial descriptions of the toy there was no mention of the body of the doll (hips/leg) being unlike your traditional Barbie.  The torso of the doll under the long skirt (not mentioned in descriptions nor pictured on the box) are one solid piece - holding the bulky sound/light box which were the selling feature of this toy to my tot.  Upon opening we were soon disappointed to learn this Barbie would never be able to be interchangable into other Barbie outfits that were not loose flowing on the legs like the dress she comes in and the legs are not flexible.  Her bodice, as seen in box, is painted on so even removing the skirt for another Barbie would mean finding another top to wear with it.  She can bend to sit but will fall over backwards as her legs are a very lightweight plastic and the top is more top-heavy.  Weeks after this was released we began seeing the version that does not light up but has an almost identical dress which is removable and has the traditional Barbie body with all it's versatility and flexible joints.Overall a beautiful idea - stunning gown and facepaint.  But if this was the final model that would accept the lights/sound features going for it should have been clearly stated by Mattel that it was not underneath a traditional Barbie.  She is only good in this one outfit. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Very pretty Barbie. It says her dress turns into 2 separate dresses but the other one doesn't look all the different from the first which isn't that surprising. My daughter thinks she's great and that's what matters. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Barbie Fashion Fairytale was much hoped-for at our house during the Christmas season, but it really fell short in my expectations of how a Barbie should be.  While the light-up features of the dress' bodice are cute, the actual Barbie cannot do much of what you would expect from a Barbie:  change clothes, move legs to dance/ride horses, try on shoes, etc.  The legs do not move and are attached together in the thigh area by a speaker box so that Barbie can play hip music.  The hot pink sparkle dress is beautiful, but the bodies is painted onto the top of Barbie and cannot be removed.  The dress turns and reverses to light pink satin, which is not as cute.  There is a silver buckle that you can push to have Barbie light up and play music.  Our buckle fell off within 2 minutes of the doll being used, and now it always falls off unless it is being held on tightly...very much at risk of being lost and losing the ability to then play the music on the doll.  Overall, a novelty Barbie: fun, but lacking the play-value of other Barbies. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We got this Barbie for Christmas, (ours came with a 3 song sample CD as well from the movie..it doesn't look like this one does.) The doll itself is very pretty, you push her belt and it plays part of the runway song I guess and her chest lights up which my 2 and 5 year olds love to do and get a kick out of doing it over and over again...but other than that, you can't do too much with this doll.  Yes, you can twirl the dress around to make it a non flashy, light pink color (like the movie as well), but her legs won't move b/c of the annoying box stuck between them for the sound/light/battery pack; her clothes do not come off.  My daughter loves Barbie and loved the movie, so I think she will play with it with the other fashion fairytale dolls/animals she got as well, but, it was a huge disappointment when we realized she didn't move at all.NOTE: After a few months, my daughter noticed that the belt buckle came loose...we have to constantly hunt for it in her bedroom to shove it back in to make the dress light up and play music. Anyone come up with a solution yet as to how to reattach it? I was going to super glue it, but then it won't press down and that would be the same as not having it there at all. HUGE disappointment as this was the ONLY thing this doll could do. BOO! :( [SEP]",[CLS] Sequin and I adore Paris!

B003H9MTJ6,"[CLS] Finally broke down after looking at it for a month or so now. Had to decide whether to spend 40 bucks on something I knew I would rarely use but looked and sounded cool as all get out. I knew the practical side of my brain was ultimately going to lose that arguement.It is lighter then I thought it would be, but has good heft once the batteries are in it. It is larger then I expected as well. Fires well from the tripod position and I haven't had any problems with jamming in that mode. I had some minor jamming holding it Rambo style and spraying the room but nothing too bad. 15-25 foot range with fairly good velocity. My four year old son thinks it is awesome and is pretty bummed that he doesn't get free reign with it and that it is dad's toy.  Seems to be made well enough to survive a day or two if I let him actually have it unsupervised but even that may be iffy. With older age groups it should hold up well.The 25 round belt goes quick though and it would be neat to see a 50 or 100 round one. Again, that has nothing to do with practicality just something that would be cool for the 20 seconds it takes to fire the rounds off. [SEP]"",""[CLS] okay, lemmi just say how awesome this thing isit is ridiculously awesomeokay, now then, to the meat of the matterplusesthis gun is ridiculously awesomeit comes with two belts (and is in fact out now, my dad and i bought two from hasbro toys and they arrived July 29I've yet to use them in our uber Nerf war campaign, but my recent Vulcan on Vulcan battle with my dad has yielded the followingrate of fire is staggering, this baby can lay down five more rounds than the rapid twenty, allowing for considerably longer bursts, given that it fires at roughly 3 darts per secondreload is on par with the Longshot for ease and speed of reload, you just pull up the chamber hatch and put in the new belt, you don't even need to remove the old one, it just falls out after firing the last rounddespite this the rounds are very secure, one can easily pick the gun up and run around with little fear of jammingthe gun also comes with two belts, allowing fifty rounds of ammo, more than any other gun by farthis, added with it's sturdy yet maneuverable tripod as well as the option to go manual (fire each round as if it were in a Longshot) make this a formidable weapon, whether you've got batteries or notnow, the downsidesthis thing is HUGEi have a bit of trouble hefting it, and I'm 16 years oldyou cannot tactically reloadthis means you can't add new rounds to a magazine or belt after firing it, meaning if you accidentally fire, or your other belt is full, you're stuck till you empty this one (Although you can, provided you pump the manual lever just right, cycle the whole belt through the gun without cocking it...though it takes an hair-touch)the gun is prone to jam(well, skip is more like it, since it cycles rounds with a system of pronged wheels) if you run around with the belt loose and don't have the box attached. in fact, without the box you're pretty much screwed trying to run with this thing (forget what you saw on the Great Office War people)and lastly, the D batteries (6 of them!) are really what make this gun, and without them, your stuck with a big long shothowever, all these problems can easily be overcome (well, except for the weight issue, so don't expect your little six year old to be running around like Rambo)and as such, this gun is beyond awesome, but definitely not worth $80, go to hasbro and buy it for 40, or if you can wait just wait till amazon comes out with itEdit:After two years (yes that's right two years) of near constant use with two of these, including running around, shooting, hitting things, stripping belts out, etc etc (in essence beating the hell out of them) I can safely sayThose people up there who talk about how it broke in five minutes I can almost personally garuntee got either the short end of the stick or were over exaggerating how it broke  I've reloaded thousands (yes literally thousands, we have nerf wars on an almost weekly basis for hours) of rounds into these belts, swapped belts hundreds of times, and the only thing that is wrong with either of them is one now has a sticky lock clamp.  (In essence, to reload you have to press the underside of the door hatch to release it, rather than just pull it up as usual) and that is a minor problem at worst.  We also have yet to need a replacement on the batteries, nor do we need to fear loss of power.  It's simply a matter of the following: little Timmy will love it, but it's a complex machine.  Don't let little Timmy try to yank on the belt or take out his aggression on it, let him sit it on a table and shoot at everyone who walks by the front of your house. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My nine year old son and my thirteen year old son wanted this for Christmas. This is the pinnacle of nerf guns in our home. It is huge and it shoots a lot of bullets and it shoots them out fast. It has been a big hit in our house.This thing takes more time to load than it does to shoot. When you shoot your bullets it takes just a minute or less; to load it takes 3 or 4 minutes it seems. So if you are going to have a nerf war you need to probably have two or three of these around or else have several back up guns or extra strings of bullets to shoot with this gun. Otherwise it becomes a very short nerf war game.This is sturdy and is in fact quite heavy.It has held up to hours of play currently.Enjoy. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The first time I encountered this Nerf gun I was impressed. It's huge, heavy, and looks intimidating! It's the Nerf equivalent of a belt-fed machine gun.The Vulcan is a fully automatic Nerf blaster. It's pneumatic and uses a spring-plunger system that is actuated by an electric motor and camming system (sort of like an airsoft gun). It runs on 6 D-cell batteries located in a battery compartment in the rear. The cool factor is very high! You get a tripod to mount it on in a fixed defensive position, but it also has a carry handle and rear pistol grip handle so you can use it as a man portable machine gun like a M240. Unfortunately all it is good for in this mode is shooting from the hip.It works pretty good, but like some other N-Strike guns, it doesn't shoot very far. The range is disappointing for such an impressive-looking gun. It runs off a 25 round ammo belt that is fed into the top of the Vulcan's receiver just like a real belt-fed weapon. There's a detatchable ammo box on the right side that holds the ammo belt, but I found it's pretty much useless and kept falling off, so I took it off. The Vulcan is also heavy. Those D-batteries add about 2 pounds to the weight, which brings it up to about 7 pounds fully loaded. This is at least twice as heavy as the other Nerf guns I have used. An adult or older kid wouldn't have any trouble, but an 8-year old would have some trouble carting it around during a battle.Nerf claims it will do 3 rounds per second, but I never saw that. Maybe 2 at the most, and it isn't the most reliable thing in the world or the fastest to reload, which is why this is good for a fixed position like defending a base or fort. The belts go fast, and when it's done you are a sitting duck unless you have a few other spare belts laying around. Reloading 25 rounds takes a long time, and sometimes it's tricky to get the belt situated. I have been on the receiving end of this though during a battle, and it's overwhelming to have 10 or 15 darts coming at you in a matter of seconds. I didn't have time to raise and fire before I was hit 5 times...dead meat!However, when the belt was empty, a team mate came and took him out with a little single-shot Reflex N-Strike pistol!I recommend buying 2 or 3 spare belts and an extra 50 darts if you want to be effective during a battle, plus you look like Rambo carrying this around with extra loaded belts! Coolness. Plus, get some rechargable batteries. Buying D-size batteries is spendy, and the batteries don't last very long if you use this a lot.Pros:Super cool lookingOverwhelming firepower (if you get it to work right)Full automatic fireIncludes tripodCons:A little tricky to set up and loadBelts are emptied quicklySlow to reloadHeavyNot very powerful, limited rangeOverall, a super cool gun that might work for you 60 percent of the time. Fantastic static defensive position weapon. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this yesterday and I haven't put it down since. Although it's a little heavy it still way better then the Stampede I think. It comes with a 25 dart loading belt, 25 darts and a tripod. You can either fire it single fire (turn the switch off, you'll have to manually pull back on the slide to feed a shot the pull the trigger to fire) or full auto (flip the switch to the on position, load the first round and pull the trigger). I haven't had any problems with mine and it rarely jams and mind you ANY auto firing weapon can jam if the bullets or darts arn't secured properly first. If treated well it will work well, if it's treated poorly then it will work poorly. I still like this gun and I highly reconmmend it over the Stampede anyday. [SEP]"",""[CLS] So ... someone over at Nerf said: Hey, everybody ... let's start manufacturing replica military weapons and we can start with the M249 SAW Machine Gun. Really, guys? Being able to successfully belt feed a machine gun while firing is a desirable skill. Okay.This thing is pretty heavy, thus if you think you're going to lug this baby around your house with the rest of your Nerf weapons and set an ambush -- guess again.This puppy is loud and there's not even any live fire going on, just the sound of plastic slamming into itself and reloading with a rattle. The thing sounds louder than a sewing machine.You're going to need to stock up big time on D batteries as this baby, when you're using it, sucks through them like Robert Pattinson in one of his movies at dinner time.The range is pretty limited and the stopping power is nil. I was overrun by crumbsnatchers packing single shot N-Strike EX-3 pistols in no time. Those things leave marks. This thing is the equivalent to someone hitting the doorbell.Jamming? About as often as Bob Marley. I experienced jams during almost every load. I was struggling to get a clean 25 shots off without having to tackle a stove-pipe or a clog. In this aspect, this is almost like the real thing, haha. Realism!Looks cool. If I had saved my reciept I probably would've returned it by now. Reloading the chain belts is incredibly tedious.... [SEP]"",""[CLS] First day we used it, the side arm broke off in my 8 year old's hand. Very disappointed. [SEP]"",""[CLS] After a full busy day of play, these guns were the clear Christmas day hit. They played with them all day. Between the two guns we had no jamming issues or belt drive failures as others have reported. It is really incredible and funny to see these things raining down a h*llfire of darts down upon someone, or knocking over a tower of plastic cups.The tripod does snap off somewhat easily, but I think it is a safety design feature-- if a kid runs with the gun and falls, you want the tripod to fall off.The guns are quite heavy and big, but that too seems to be part of the attraction.UPDATE: Well, it is February, and they play with these about every other day, and they are still operating fine. So I'd say there isn't a quality issue with the gun we got. [SEP]","[CLS] From the ManufacturerComplete your N-STRIKE arsenal and prepare for the ultimate in battery-powered blasting.

B003HC92N4,"[CLS] I admit I'm surprised by how much my daughter likes this truck. Not only does it 'go' with motorized action, she's loving taking it apart and putting it back together. It's also bigger than I expected, and is fairly sturdy. The accessories are diverse and interchangeable and I like that some can be mixed and matched with other vehicles in this line. She's really enjoying the screwdriver/wrench type piece that allows you to 'put' everything together; she says she's just like Daddy. :) It was also easy to remove from the box, using twine rather than those annoying wire/plastic ties that seem to be so popular nowadays. We'll definitely be looking for more vehicles in line! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My nephew enjoyed this Tonka Truck very much.  He is turning 4 in a month and he was playing with it for about an hour.  The truck comes with some accessories and 4 interchangeable tires.  You can remove the body off the truck and change the wheels.  It has sounds and runs in a straight line on it's own power.  It's not too powerful, at least mine wasn't and did not run too well on carpet.  Maybe it just needs a new battery.It's pretty neat and would be ideal for any kid under 5 I say.  The only problem with toys is that with today's youth, they are tech savvy at a young age.  After an hour of playing with it, he wanted to go back to playing with my iPhone.  It's a great toy and great for helping young ones learn hand coordination skills in a fun way.  They can take it apart and rebuild it with ease.  I recommend it.  I know for a fact when I was 4 years old I would have loved something like this. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Great things about this truck:+ Batteries included!+ Enough parts for 2 configurations+ Tool included+ Lots of cool sounds and motion+ Nice assessoriesAt first glance, my 10YO said that's for babies. But this toy is not for babies or toddlers. The appropriate age range for this toy would probably be 4-8 year olds. The truck is part of a Mod Machines system and its parts are interchangeable with other Mod Machines.The top and bottom of the truck are removeable. I'm surprised to read some of the other reviews complaining about not being able to understand how to use the toy. There is one tool. There are screws at various places on the toy. Turn the screws with the tool to seperate the pieces or put them together however you like. The instructions show the user how to create a low, fast truck or a high, powerful truck. Also, the child can use his imagination to create all sorts of different trucks trying his own configurations. Despite calling the truck a baby toy, my son and his friends have played with the truck for an hour now and built it a dozen different ways.This toy is very educational and durable. Most children are used to discovering things through trial and error, so this is perfect. The pieces are very durable.I wish this had come out when my son was younger. He would've gotten all Mod Machines! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My son is an avid car/truck/train/anything with wheels fan. We've had countless different take apart vehicles over the years and they have all either been too complex or too simplistic. This series of trucks is the perfect fit for my 5-year-old. He LOVES taking the body off and looking at the engine. He was amazed that he could actually take the working engine out of the body and move to different places. The wheels are nice, not super rubbery that they will attract pet hair that will never come off but not so smooth and cheap that it provides no traction. It's the perfect combination of traction and ease of cleaning. It's very easy for him to take the parts on and off, which is not something I can say for all toys of this type. And the main screws that hold the body on don't come completely off the body so they can't be lost! Yay! The truck is also extremely durable. It's quite heavy and very solid, yet the accessory parts are nice and pliable to ensure they won't snap in half during rough play. We also love that there's more trucks in the series that we can buy and switch the parts around with. Great idea! The best part seemed to be that the truck actually drives. It's just a simple push the button and the truck goes forward for a bit, but it's been a really fun feature to switch all the tires around and watch how goofy the truck drives with different size tires on each side.Overall, we think its a fantastic toy for little truck lovers and wannabe mechanics. My son has had a great time with it and we will probably pick up another truck or two come Christmas. My only gripe is it does seem a LITTLE overpriced for what you get. If they knocked it down just a bit, it would be easier to swallow and I could easily recommend it to everyone as a great value. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 6 y.o. son loves this! It is basic in the sense that building, and taking apart and rebuilding is pretty straight forward (for me), however, it is the perfect balance for my son. Not too difficult but also not too easy. Aligning some of the pieces was a bit of a challenge, but not the kind of challenge that ends in frustration and makes you give up. Nothing beats the old metal Tonka's that I used to play with, but those days are long gone. Still, this is a solid toy, and even with my sons less than careful/delicate force, it is doing just fine. What is also nice was all the extra wheels. The different sizes at first made it pull to one side, and my son thought it was poorly made. When he changed the wheels to have the same size on both sides, he realized it was the wheels that caused it....a nice little lesson learned. My son has been enjoying himself quite a bit. I think it's a winner. It is a little difficult getting the wheels on and off....but that's good. No broken pieces of plastic. It came all tied up, and getting it apart was the most frustrating thing for my son (and me). You can use it with 6 wheels or 4. The motor is strong enough to push it over little hills (aka, books placed under the carpet that my son made as a hill). The only real negative is that the motor control button is burried, and you cannot turn it off without taking the cab off. I would have knocked off half a star for that, just because it is not hard to design it with an easier access. This is easily a hit! Your kids will love it....and you might too!  ;-) [SEP]"",""[CLS] I picked up the Tonka Tough Shifters Powered Semi for my nephew since he loves building type toys and motorized vehicles. I wasn't sure that it would hold his interest for long, but it seemed worth a shot. The packaging is easy enough to get into provided you have some scissors, as you won't really want to untie all the wire ties that hold it in the packaging. Once you get it out, you basically see everything you get, the truck, some interchangeable wheels, the Tonka tool needed to disassemble it and a few snap on additions. I thought that there'd be more than that, but my nephew didn't seem to mind. Once he realized that you could hit the red button and it would move as well as make noise, that's when he fell in love with it. He would just change the tires and let it go. He really loved being able to take the engine out. He wasn't able to get it out on his own the first time, so I showed him how to use the tool to do it, disassembled it and put it together. Once I went through the steps, he was able to do them on his own like a champ.Overall, I'm very pleased with this item. If I have any criticism of the Tonka Tough Shifters Powered Semi, it's that I wish it would move a bit faster and had a few more accessories to customize how it looks. As it is, my nephew had a blast with it, and he's still playing with it a week later, so all-in-all, it's a great, durable truck that provides a bit more activity than a run-of-the-mill one. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a great toy for a child who loves to play mechanic, but there are a lot of pieces, as pretty much the whole thing comes apart. It's durable, if you can keep all the pieces in one place. I don't know what toy storage is like in your house, but it's a bit of a challenge in ours. Other than that, it is motorized and moves pretty well with realistic sounds. We enjoyed it a lot for a brief period of time. Once the newness wore off, he never touched it again.

Of the now 40 that my son has received, played with daily in his marble runs as well as rolled around our house's tile floors, thrown more than once during tantrums, placed in enclosed containers and shaken around making music, etc etc, not a single marble has broken in any way, no chips, no problems at all. I'm so very glad I found these and look forward to doling them out over the coming months, as my son's face just lights up every time I tell him I've got new marbles for him, and he loves examining them and telling me the different colors and patterns he sees!Note that the iPad in the picture is a 9.7 inch iPad Air II in a normal size case, to give size perspective :) [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a large tin filled with marbles of various colors and shapes.

B003N8GELA,"[CLS] My 5 y.o. wanted an American Girl doll for her birthday, but she still plays pretty tough with her dolls and I couldn't justify the money. This doll was on sale on Amazon for 29!! Her face and hair are very pretty! We also have one of the Our Generation dolls from Target and this doll is much much prettier. Her body is kind of mushy though, and it seems like her legs can fall off easily!! One of them is kind of out of the socket. Her torso is soft while her limbs are rubber, so her body really doesn't support her head and limbs. I would send her back, but my daughter would be heartbroken! I suggest ordering this beautiful doll, but inspecting it before giving it to a little girl to fall in love with. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My mother collected the traditional (much smaller) Madame Alexander dolls when I was a child, and I loved admiring them as I grew up. I thought, Hmm, these could be real contenders for American Girl if they're anywhere as nice as the dolls Madame Alexander is known for.But they aren't.One pro over similar dolls is that their upper chest area is plastic with the cloth portion not starting as high as AG dolls, so more clothing options (including sewing your own) are available, like v-necks or sundresses, without showing the cloth part.Otherwise, though, they're far inferior to both AG dolls and the traditional Madame Alexander ones. The face on this one looks overdone, like a teenager or pre-teen who is first learning to put on make-up. The hair is an odd color - not quite blond but not red and not really strawberry blond either. The bangs are curled in a similar style to what I wore... in the 80s. The curly hair was crunchy feeling upon removal from the box. My daughter asked, Why does her hair feel yucky? It's better and softer now, but it definitely dulled the love my daughter had for this doll as compared to other playthings. (She's big into looks and textures!) The clothes are excellent, though the leggings keep sliding off her butt because the fabric of the body is slippery.All in all, this doll is nice, but I wouldn't pay more than $30 or $35, given the quality. A couple of the options by Madame Alexander offer more ethnicity options than American Girl, and of course, the Madame Alexander ones are cheaper, but I have seen other options for AG alternatives more readily available (like the My Generation ones from Target) or more diverse (like the Hearts for Hearts girls) and at a lower price point than these. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Too Cute in Boots is the perfect name for this doll.  She is so pretty!  When I opened the box I immediately fell in love with her, and when my four year old granddaughter saw her it was love at first sight.  My granddaughter has long hair and it's fun for her to have a doll whose hair she can brush like her own.  I think the price is good for such a beautiful doll. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is such a cute little doll :) My granddaughter loved it and she has been carrying it around since she opened it. The doll came with the cutest little pink boots and she has a pair of pink boots so she call her her little twin :) [SEP]"",""[CLS] I got this for my daughter for her fourth birthday along with a matching tea set and chairs and table. She loves the doll and immediately wanted to cuddle her and carry her around with her like a baby. The plastic head, arms and legs are not plasticy but feel soft to the touch. The body is material and stuffed with filling which makes the doll cuddly. The clothes are adorable - the attention to detail on the boots and denim jacket very nice. I love the blonde curls and sweet face. A real winner! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Madame Alexander is a famous brand for dolls, and this doll's face lives up to it. She is beautiful. Fortunately she arrived in good shape -- no problems. However I did not read the reviews until after I received the doll and due to some of the reviews, I took the doll out of the box completely to check it over (it will be a Christmas gift). I do see what is meant by a wobbly head. Fortunately mine is okay. The entire issue with this doll is the way the joints are made. They are not poseable as the box states. The doll cannot sit. so the joints are somewhat loose, but not so loose that I'm sending it back. It's a lovely doll (beautiful face and hair) with a darling outfit. I thought it was a GREAT price (compared with American Girl dolls). However when I read a review that said Walmart has this brand of dolls for $25, I was dismayed that I paid twice that much. So, I can't recommend the doll wholeheartedly, but I'm keeping it for my granddaughter. I don't think she's so spoiled by American Girl dolls that she will dislike it. And, again, I think the face is one of the loveliest, if not prettier than American Girl.

B003NF7OAI,"[CLS] The T.S. Shure Wooden Magnets Alphabet Letter set is fantastic. I have a metal sheet on the wall of my game room and these are perfect for sitting on the floor with the grandkids learning letters and even to a small degree, spelling words. It works well even for an 18 month old (with supervision) as he can pick up the items and arrange them on the wall - the magnets hold very well.The Letters are made of wood and each piece has a picture on it that begins with that letter.  For instance, Q has a quail, R has a rooster, and Z has a zebra.  If you are willing to invest in a couple of sets as I am, you can use the magnetic letters to form simple words.  With a single set, you can form words provided there are no letter duplications.I have a few of the T.S. Shure products and am very impressed by their quality and attention to detail. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This review is for the T.S. Shure Alphabet Wooden Magnetic Letters.  This is our second product from T.S. Shure and we are very pleased.  The quality of the magnets and pictures is equal to that of a popular brand.  The magnets are strong enough to stay on the refrigerator or other magnetic surface without slipping. The pictures act as cues to help your child recognize each letter. Cues are incredibly helpful when teaching a child to read.  It helps them build confidence and figure out the right answer!  We promptly played a game of Alphabet Soup!  Take the letters and put them in a saucepan....oops....as you accidentally spill them on the carpet.  Call out a letter and have the children pick them up one at  a time!I have uploaded a picture of both the famous brand (left) and the T.S. Shure Wooden Magnetic letters for your review!

He's using them to help him learn the sounds letters make. Unfortunately, the magnetic backing of the letters is pretty weak, meaning they slide around our fridge more than he (or I) would like.

It comes in a wooden box with a plastic sliding lid that provides easy and compact storage (which I love). I also like that each letter has a small picture in the bottom corner of something that begins with that letter. This is an inexpensive set that can be used in many different ways. [SEP]"",""[CLS] These T.S. Shure Wooden Magnetic Alpahbet Letters are pretty ok. My daughters (one 4 years-old and twins who are inching up on 3 years) sure seem to love them. We have a metal front door, so I find these all over it just about every other day. The letter's size is just about perfect for their little hands and the magnets (more of a magnetic coating on the back of the letters) are strong enough to keep them on our door, refrigerator or dishwasher. They're even strong enough to hang a list or painting on the fridge, so that's a bonus (and something the last set of magnetic letters I bought couldn't do).These seem to be well-made enough, but after a week of play, I'm already noticing some of the letters with some rather notable scratches and with edges that are peeling up (as usual, these wooden are basically wood-like composite material that's layered; the top layer with the pictures is starting to peel off some of them). For the asking price, I probably shouldn't expect too terribly much, but to see it just coming apart like that on several of the letters, well, I did expect them to at least hold together for a bit longer. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Very cute design, but a few of our pieces were warped a bit, making them not stick on the metal surface very well. I'm hoping it was just a flaw on ours and not on many. My daughter still loves to play with them. [SEP]"",""[CLS] They're cute..... My son loves playing with magnets on the refrigerator, and they keep him busy while I cook dinner.  Each letter has a picture accompanying it that starts with that letter - so you can also use them to teach your child words and sounds.

Definitely a gentle giant, Ferdinand is bigger and slower than his two co-workers, and can make special tweeting sounds when he whistles (in the movie, that is... not in Take-n-Play's train).  All of the other engines that have tenders carry coal, but Ferdinand runs on wood and oil, and his tender is full of wood chips.  (However, our grandson always insisted that they're chocolate chips!)  Painted an attractive teal with grey lining and a total of 12 matching teal wheels, he has a semi-circular symbol depicting 3 yellow trees with 2 brown axes crossing each other on both sides of his cab and tender.  We paid $8.99 for our oldest grandson's back in 2010 as part of the beginning of what would become a complete 4 year collection of Take-n-Play.  These models back then were just SO terrific - weighty feeling diecast metal, an incredible amount of detailing - we were so happy with our investment, and our grandson enjoyed deciding which of his gang would see action each day!  If you're planning to purchase Ferdinand for your youngster, he's also part of a themed 3-pack (Muddy Ferdinand), there's a talking version as well, but if you want the non-talking version, THIS is the model you want... there's a plasticized, stripped down version coming out in 2015 (model #CBL89) that doesn't do this great character justice.We've added two more grandsons since then and had fully planned to keep our collection going.  Unfortunately, we'd seen some distressing signs of a quality downturn beginning in 2013 that led us to stop collecting at the end of the year.  Production was moved from China to Thailand that year, and many of the models were reissued with alterations (mostly to their faces and wheels.)  In 2014, things continued on a downhill slide... windows were blacked out on once open cabs, the cabs and domes got shorter, the tender engines ALL went to only four wheels on their tenders (prior to that, most of them had six... Emily, Molly, Duke and Ferdinand were the only ones that always had four - and Hiro, Connor and Caitlin had eight!), most of the models lost their painted buffers/cylinders - it was really a sad decline to watch.  Unfortunately late 2014 into 2015 has proven even worse, with unbelievably plasticized models of what used to be the highest quality diecast line of trains you could wish for.  We weren't able to afford the wooden trains, and these fit our budget.  We're glad we invested, but also glad we got out when we did!  If you plan to purchase Take-n-Play, we hope you're able to get some of the older, high quality models before they're all replaced.  (And just so you're aware, Take-n-Play products are not compatible with wooden tracks.)Fisher-Price includes a yearly Collector Checklist with some (not all) Take-n-Play items, though it was never a comprehensive list and now just uses it as a sales pitch for the most recent stuff.  I'm going back through all of my train reviews to provide a complete list of train characters that have been introduced into the line since 2010 (in order), not just for serious collectors, but also for those who'd just like to know what their other options are as far as Thomas' co-workers goes (and the farther back you go, the better the quality... IF, that is, you get the ORIGINAL models!)

(And that doesn't even include the NON-train characters!)10/25/16 update:  I'm going back and adding this update to each of my Take-n-Play reviews, since it's important information for any parents/grandparents out there with a young Thomas & Friends enthusiast who holds a special place in their heart, and is considering beginning a collection for them.  I just found out the TnP line of diecast trains/vehicles/rolling stock with magnetic connectors is being REPLACED by Fisher-Price in 2017 with a diecast line called Thomas & Friends Adventures, which will be TnP models modified with PLASTIC HOOK & LOOP COUPLERS.  Obviously, your youngster will not be able to connect the 2014-2016 TnP models (with their flat, round 1-way magnetic connectors), nor the 2010-2014 TnP models - or Learning Curve's compatible 2002-2010 Take Along models - with their protruding 2-way magnetic connectors - with the new types of couplers as of next year.2/17/17 Update:  Fisher-Price must've received a slew of complaints from Take-n-Play owners, because they've now developed magnetic clip engine connectors (to clip onto the magnetic trains - but ONLY those with the flat round 1-way magnets... they don't want to invite comparisons between the high quality of the older trains with protruding 2-way magnets! - that have a plastic hook & loop coupler to be able to connect to the new Adventures engines), along with track adapter pieces (Take-n-Play track pieces/sets have only 1 male or female part at the end to connect up to other track/sets, while the new Adventures tracks/sets have both one male & 1 female part on EACH end), available by directly contacting F-P.

B003Q0CB26,"[CLS] I was trying to find a somewhat interactive horse toy for my daughter, and many of the other interactive horse toys like the RoboHorse and the FurrFriends horse are either discontinued or rare, so I was thrilled to see that this was a toy that might neigh, sign, whinney, etc.  I read all of the reviews before I purchased, and then I went with my gut.  Although some of the sensors are difficult to find until you become familiar with the toy, all of the actions work.  After vet care becomes monotonous, the toy is soft to hug and hang out with the other gobs of plush horses in her room. The horse doesn't have a dozen of different uses or actions, so it is what it is and you have to gauge how long it may keep interest.  Since my daughter is overly concerned about her toy horses getting colic, she uses the medical items from the kit for other plush toys too. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Well I read all the reviews including the bad ones and hoped mine would be different.  It wasn't.  Did not work.  You could hear the tail trying to work.  Couldn't find the shot area and the otoscope didn't work.  Was a present for my daughter, so disappointed and returned.  Boo! [SEP]"",""[CLS] hard to play with [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this for my daughter for christmas, it came as described.  We haven't opened it yet because it for christmas 2014, yes I start early only because I don't do crowds.  It is a good size horse and the box it came in was not damaged at all.  Well worth the money from what I see. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Other than being a cute stuffed animal there is not much I can say about this thing other than a total waste of money.  seriously the stethoscope does not make sound in the ears just at the bottom where you put against the horses chest.  The hoof pick works on one hoof.  and the needle it almost impossible to find the Spot to work.  And brushing its hair it makes noise from time to time.  I am surprised that this has the Breyer name attacked to it.  It was for my grand daughters birthday so there was no way to convince a  year old to send back her plushy horse for something else.  But I'm sure it will be tossed in a corner and not played with long because she has a Dr set that works great that she plays with all the time this she put down and played with a play dough set all night.,  If you find this some place like big lots for 10 bucks it might be worth it but for the price I feel ripped off.  And if you do get this and ignore my warning.  At least open the box before the person you are giving it to get it and take all the stuff apart took me 30 minuted to untie all the junk in the box with a toddler glaring at me waiting.  This needs a micro Philips screw driver to open the battery box so make sure you have one.  Or you are not getting in I just lucked out that we had one Im sure most people don't have one that small. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My daughter received this for her birthday and was instantly in love.  It's a very cute horse, complete with a vet kit - how cool can you get?  Our issue is that the horse seems to be able to do nothing it says it can on the box.  It swished its tail twice when the batteries were first inserted, and is now no longer able to do this.  It never sighed or whinnied.  The stethoscope and light are cute and have their own independent battery systems, so they seem to work for now, but it is very expensive for a stuffed horse that does nothing.  Such a neat idea, I really wish it worked! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 3 yo daughter was thrilled to get this for Christmas. I liked the idea to use the various tools in the right places to make certain sounds. However within just a few minutes of my daughter playing with this toy, she started crying. The sound unit was making a horrible noise and it wouldn't stop. I turned the unit off and waited awhile, thinking my daughter may have jarred it too hard and I just needed to show her to be more careful. But it didn't work. As soon as I turned the unit back on, the noise started again. This was so disappointing, especially because it more than $40.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] The sound quality in this is WAY better than I expected, and I'm shocked that the strings haven't broken because we've adjusted them several times (including our four-year-old son tuning the guitar by tightening the strings as much as he can). Our almost 2 year old has strummed it too, without damaging it at all. I think other reviewers are right that this is technically a ukulele, but my daughter doesn't care about that distinction, and neither do I. :) [SEP]"",""[CLS] This guitar is pretty, but not much else.  It isn't very musical and you can't actually tighten the strings.  Oh well. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My five-year-old daughter has been asking for a guitar for quite some time, and when I had the chance to try out this Disney Princess mini guitar, I thought it would be great for her.  She was very excited, at first, but within a few minutes of strumming this small plastic ukulele she asked me to buy her a real guitar.  There's nothing exactly wrong with this child's toy, but one should not expect it to satisfy any desires for a real guitar.  It seems best suited for a three-year-old's less judgmental play time.It's pretty small for my five-year-old, and not even her intense love for Disney princesses and all things pink can make her appreciate this toy.  Parents should note that this is a four-string, relatively quiet, can be tuned (to a degree), and it's made from pretty cheap plastic, so don't expect it to last long especially if your child is rowdy with toys.  If your child, perhaps ages two to four, really loves Disney and desires a guitar, this is not a bad toy.  But be prepared to be asked for a real guitar sooner or later. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The first thing I noticed is that both ends of this box were open so I'm wondering if it was a return. There's no directions, no pick, nothing but this so called guitar. We spent more time trying to tune this than time spent playing with it. The plastic is thin, very thin. Fo 25, I expected more than this.This looks and feels cheap, if you left your 2 or 3 year old alone with this, I'm most certain either the princesses would get all scratched up or they would crack the plastic. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My review for this as a guitar would be 1 star, because this isn't a guitar. It is a ukulele, so the review is of this UKULELE.First, it is small, but if you view it as a ukulele and not a guitar, the size is correct. If you're wanting it as a play guitar, know that as a guitar it is sized for a 2 year old. The strings are pretty bad, but they are not easily snapped, which is important in a kid's instrument. (They tend to pluck really hard at times.) It is made of plastic, not a traditional wood. 4 strings (because it is a ukulele) not 6 (because it is not a guitar). It actually has decent tuners. It has proven itself durable so far. I think I might grab some better strings to see if we can't make some better music with it. [SEP]",[CLS] Let's play music!

B003RDJYMM,"[CLS] I was in a local board game shop that popped up before the holidays and I noticed The Magic Labyrinth was on sale, so I figured I'd take a chance on it.  It SEEMED like it might be geared a bit towards younger people based on the art on the box, but for the price I thought what the heck.I got it home and read the rules.  Easy to play??  Absolutely.  I set the game up for a play session with my wife.  We used, for the first game, the basic setup that it shows in the manual.  I told my wife how to play, and we were off.About 20 minutes later, she had gotten her fifth magic object and had defeated me, 5-4.We promptly tore the top off of the board and placed the remaining obstacles and had another go at it.I really, REALLY enjoyed the game.  It's a lot of fun, and it definitely takes some thought and memory skills to remember where you've already been.  I found myself, on more than one occasion, getting caught by the same walls.  I had started working on remembering the middle of the board, and forgot that the spot right above my starting point was covered by a wall.The playing pieces and board itself are very well made.  I can see what another reviewer is thinking when they wonder if the part of the game board that the obstacles hook into will last, but I think the cardboard is strong enough that it won't be too much of an issue.  I also think the instructions were well written.  They even have a suggestion for easily getting your metal ball back out of the ball returns.Overall, I think this is a great game.  My wife and I are both right around 30 years old, and we had an absolute blast playing Magic Labyrinth.  Definitely a good purchase.  I can't wait to play it with a few more players...I'm sure it will be VERY fun with more than just the two of us!!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] After reading the other reviews of this game I was unsure if I was going to like it or not but I am glad that I did.  The concept of the game is that you are in a magic labyrinth trying to be the first one to collect five treasures by making your way through a maze with invisible walls (the pieces are magnetized and attached to a metal ball beneath the board.  When the ball runs into one of the wooden walls placed on the fist layer of the board the ball drops down and you start over).  The design is very creative and components are well made.  It is also nice because the maze can be changed after every round and with varying degree of difficulty to accommodate different age ranges and levels of skill.  As far as the issue that others had of being able to feel the walls before you hit them one simple rule change easily fixed this problem.  Namely before a player moves their piece they have to declare where they are going.  Since they have already determined their route before they move the piece there is no incentive to try and cheat.  While it is marketed as a kids game my wife and I enjoyed playing it with just the two of us and found the most difficult mazes challenging enough to keep us interested.  Books A Million had this on sale for $12 buy one get one half off so I got it for just $6 which was a steal for a game of this quality.  If you can find it for $20 or less I wouldn't hesitate to add this one to your game collection.

B003S3RGJO,"[CLS] Fun to do [SEP]"",""[CLS] Love these puzzles! Fast shipping too! [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is your standard exceptional quality puzzle by Ravensburger. For those who are not familiar with Ravensburger, the puzzle pieces are of a canvas-style appearance, are carefully cut with SHARP tools, fit cleanly together, have exquisite detail that matches the cover, and are thick enough to hold together. This is the only puzzle maker from whom I would consider buying a more challenging puzzle. My daughter loves the fact that there is very little puzzle debris in the box (or, as she calls it, puzzle poop). I am addicted to jigsaws, and of all the puzzles I have ever owned or worked, Ravensburger is the best.  This particular puzzle was both easy and difficult: the sea meets the sky in an easily identified line, the shading of the sky is straightforward, and the greenery is distinctive, making it easy; however, the rocks and sand were challenging and took more than twice as long as the rest of the puzzle. When I finished this one, my husband looked longingly at the image and offered to take me to Hawaii again. That was the best $20 ever spent!!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Ravensburger is the best puzzle brand we have found. The quality of their puzzles is always top notch. The pieces fit together nicely, the image is always bright and crisp, and the pieces don't bend or break apart like with some puzzles. All Ravensburger puzzle pieces are blue on the back, which is a nice touch, but sometimes makes it a bit more challenging to pick out blue pieces such as sky. They also come in a nice sturdy box.Another great feature of all Ravensburger puzzles is that they are packaged in a plastic bag (within the box) that is labeled with a batch number that you can use to try to get replacement pieces. We have never had a puzzle from them that was missing any pieces (and we have done around 20-30+ of their puzzles), but if you happen to end up with any missing pieces yourself, you should have the batch number available so you can contact Ravensburger's customer service (through their company website). I suggest that when you open up your puzzle, you write the number from the bag on the inside of your box. This way, you don't have to keep the bag around, and you will always have the appropriate batch number with each puzzle. Their current policy states that they are not always able to replace single pieces, but they will do their best to resolve the situation. Their manufacturing process requires they change the cutting tools every so many puzzles (and this process changes the shapes of the pieces), so my guess is that you will be able to get replacement pieces as long as your puzzle is from the current cutting tools.This particular puzzle has a beautiful beach scene with pretty colors. I would say this one is moderately challenging compared to other 1000 piece puzzles. [SEP]","[CLS] Ravensburger has been making toys for the hand, head, and heart for over 130 years.

B003TU7ZIS,"[CLS] I love playing wooden blocks since I was a child. But there is a different twist with these wooden blocks - magnets - not flimsy magnets, but real powerful magnets. Each block is embedded with a magnet that makes the satisfying clicks every time you put them together. It is strong enough to make them hold together, but not too strong to squeeze or injure a child's little fingers.The quality of each piece is superb. It has no sharp edges whatsoever. Workmanship is fantastic.I have 3 kids (5, 6 and 11 years old) who plays with them for hours. They also love to bring them in the car. It is also one of those nerdy toys that is great as an office desk toy, like those bucky magnets or Japanese zen sand boxes.I first wondered what kind of wood they were using to make them. I found the answer from their website. The wood is called Huesito, also called bonewood, a kind of hardwood that is light and dense, and often used to make tool handles. It is not very popular in US, but grows in abundance in Honduras. It has grain patterns that look nice and fairly represented on these toy blocks.The manufacturer makes claim of embracing the green movement and protecting the environment. Their have a mission of helping the poor section of Honduras whence they manufacture these toys, creating jobs and putting street kids to school. One tree can harvest 500 sets of toy blocks, and for every block set they sell, they plant 12 new trees helping reforestation in Honduras.

B0042ET8OO,"[CLS] Good strategy game [SEP]"",""[CLS] Easy to keep clean, whole thing washable--box it came in too thin, in my opinion.  A fun game to play without getting bored with it after 2-3 times.  Very popular. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We purchased this as a replacement.  We are sorely disappointed in the construction.  The board flexes when you try to move pieces making it difficult to pick up the pieces.  We had the older durable version that was black with green felt,it was much much better in construction (only reason we don't still have it is because we lost it in a house fire...otherwise it was still in excellent condition after years of use).  I would not recommend this version of the game.  It is too cheaply made. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Othello is one those rare and unique games like Chess, Checkers, and Go that require nothing but strategy to win. There really is no luck involved whatsoever, and the rules are quite simple: use your pieces to surround that of your opponent's so you can flip their pieces over, revealing your color which is on the bottom side of their pieces. At the end of the game, the player who has the most pieces showing his/her color is the winner. The rules are real simple, and yet it can be such a difficult game to win.I was introduced to this game when I was a kid and have loved it ever since. There is so much strategy involved with every move you make, and you also need to pay close attention to where your opponent is playing his/her pieces. One bad decision can turn into disaster, especially late in the game. It's not unusual to feel nervous when playing a close game, because your strategy can change so much that you may wonder if you're making the right decisions, and you might be hoping your opponent either plays or doesn't play in a certain spot. There are no dice or cards or any other luck factors involved in determining the winner. It all comes down to brains: who can play in the right spots at the right time in order to score the most points and also keep those points by the time the board is completely filled.You can make a strong case for Chess as being the best strategy game of all time, but Othello ranks right up there beside it. The rules for Othello however are much more simple and straightforward, but like chess, it can be so difficult to win. There's an old slogan for Othello which is, A minute to learn, a lifetime to master, and that's a very accurate description for this game. You can play a game where everything seems to work in your favor and win it easily with a lopsided score like 50-14, feeling like you're the best Othello player in the world; then you'll play another game and get thumped with a score like 17-47 and feel like you couldn't do anything right if your life depended on it. That's how much the strategy of this game can change. It has to keep evolving so you can try staying a step ahead of your opponent. It's such a great and rewarding feeling when you outsmart your opponent to win the game, especially if it's a close score like 33-31, but when you lose, you can't help but think back to some of the questionable moves you made earlier in the game. Simply put, Othello is a very fun and classic strategy game that requires all the power of your brain in order to win.

B0042ET8S0,"[CLS] I loved UNO as a kid and I play it now and my kids love it too.  So with my kids being Uno enthusiast they wanted this UNO Attack Game for Christmas.  I found it here on Amazon and we all love it.  It takes UNO to another level and makes the already fun game even more fun.  You get the launcher and 112 cards - the unit takes 3 C batteries and those are NOT included.  This simple addition really adds a whole new level of fun to UNO - this game is officially apart of our family game picks.Playing UNO Attack is really easy the the printed rules are as simple and straight-forward like the original UNO. All you do is push the launcher button on the shooter if you cannot match the card in the discard pile with a card from your deck.  You're lucky if nothing comes out of the attack shooter. If you're not lucky, the attack shooter will fire out a stream of UNO Attack! cards. The shooter makes a variety of sounds to further increase the excitement of the game. As the game builds to a dramatic finish, don't forget the magic words when a single card remains in a players handUNO! [SEP]"",""[CLS] A must have game. This game is the highlight of every party so far. You start off playing your own game and then suddenly alliances are made to outwit and outplay others. The game can change at any point. It is different than Uno Card Game. You have several cards that are game changers. For instance, the card that can change the color being played while forcing everyone to press the button on the Uno Attack machine. Sometimes you get no cards and other times you might get 2, 5, 9, etc... I have seen people go from calling Uno to having almost a deck of cards. There really isn't a limit on how many people can play. For us we just use multiple decks of Uno Attack Cards when playing with big groups and even sometimes have used two Uno Attack machines for each side of the table. Doing that just makes it more fun...suddenly if one hasn't spit out any cards recently that side of the table suddenly wants to use the other machine on the other side of the table. Everyone is just on pins and needles hoping the Uno Attack machine doesn't spit out cards when they press the button. Love the suspense.  One time we had one player hit the button 8 different times and this person had already called Uno. Well, long story short we all decided to work together...there were four of us in a row that had 2x playing card which means you have to hit the button twice. We were all able to play our matching cards to where the player with Uno was forced to hit the Uno Attack button 8 times in a row...which means you are getting cards one way or another...afterwards the person was literally sorting out a deck of cards in their hand and well didn't win by a long shot. Other times suddenly it is girls against guys, or groups against groups etc... Alliances just form automatically. This game is easy to play and is for all ages...it definitely brings out your competitive side. And take it from me...I love games and this is by far the best, hands down. No one has never not had fun playing this game. In fact, people who have played go out and buy their own to play with others. You can never get tired of this game.

Sometimes you get one card and sometimes it gives you more. It makes noises when its ready to shoot out cards which created anticipation. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Students will absolutely love this game.

Just as you play the original, but this one has a battery powered card holder that sits in the middle of the table.

We all had a blast playing it!The only complaint I have about it is the card holder. It doesn't always work correctly and it also jams the cards sometimes and you have to open it up and fix it.

Pictographs are fine normally, but there are screws that are the same size but color coded so we have some random colors in some places.  It seems like we were a color short for the roofing.  Really wish the directions had words with it for more detail!The bedroom is a little small for the bed.And lastly, one of the walls in the back is just a mm too small.  The way the frame fit together made a hairline space.  If that wall gets bumped too hard, we're going to be trying to get it back in there.Took about six hours to assemble, but we were juggling kids and trying to figure out which color coded bolt/screw that's the same size as another color coded bolt/screw went where.

B0042GNSRA,"[CLS] Here's the effect: You ask a spectator to think of a number between 1-60 and to not tell you the number. You hand them six cards that have 30 or so different numbers on them. You ask the spectator to hand you all the cards that have their number on it. No matter how many cards you're given, you will know the number they're thinking of.This is an old principle where the cards and the numbers do all the work and it's virtually undetectable. What the spectator sees is 30 random numbers per card. Also, multiple numbers repeat besides the number your spectator is thinking of. So, it's not about figuring out which number is the same on the cards you're given. I guarantee no one will figure out the secret. They can examine the cards and you can repeat the trick using a different number and they still won't get it. You'll just need to do some basic math and you can get the thought of number pretty quickly. There's no shuffling through the cards suspiciously. You'll know their number in seconds.The only critique I have are the cards they give you are a little ridiculous. They all have pictures of Criss Angel on the back standing in a vest with no shirt on giving a stupid look. It just looks really corny to me and I feel like they could have done without it.

B0042RU06G,"[CLS] My husband and I started putting a little money aside each week to collect all of the Take-n-Play playsets released between 2010 through the end of 2013 for our grandsons, and the nice design feature of Take-n-Play playsets allows you to connect them up to each other, but you can really maximize playtime fun by adding one of the additional track pieces and letting your youngster use his/her imagination!  In 2010, Fisher-Price took over the Thomas diecast line from Learning Curve's Take-Along, renaming it Take-n-Play, and the following year they released several options for track additions - the S-Curve was one of them, and although this probably wouldn't be the first one you'd want to add, given it's all one piece and is limited to its S configuration, it has a couple of gate arms that snap into place at each end that allows your youngster to be the one in charge of which trains can proceed, and which need to stop!  It also folds up for storage (just keep track of those gate arms!)  Other 2011 options were a 22 piece Straight & Curved Track (which contains varying lengths of both straight and curved pieces of track that interlock with each other and the playsets), a 20 piece Straight, Curved & Crossing Track Pack (which, in addition to varying lengths of straight and curved track pieces, also includes a plus sign shaped piece with 4 connection points and a curvish T shape piece with 3 connections points), a Flexi Track (a bendable piece of track with pieces that can be added/removed dependent upon the desired length), and a Bridge (all one piece, with a couple of supports that raise the middle section @ 2 high - each end has a rotating lever that allows a train to go either to the left or the right for a total of four connection points, and folds up for storage.  Unfortunately, while trains can fit underneath the bridge if they're NOT on a piece of track, the middle section is just a hair too short to allow a train to pass underneath if it's actually on a piece of track.)In 2013, a couple of more options were added - a Bridge Pack (contains a couple of 1-1/4H bridge pieces, which nothing can actually pass under... more like little hills, along with other loose pieces of track, which all interlock), and a Mini Spiral Track (skip it... three interlocking pieces of curved track with three supports of varying length that you snap on to form a spiral - pretty useless, in our opinion.)  The MSRP back in 2011 was $11 for the S-Curve (Fisher-Price lists a $12 MSRP as of March 2015.)We were considering starting a wooden train collection in 2010, as first time grandparents, but they were out of our price range.  (And just so you're aware, Take-n-Play products are not compatible with wooden tracks.)  The Take-n-Play diecast line was easier on our budget, and the weighty feeling, highly detailed diecasts coupled with the well constructed, equally highly detailed playsets of the first three years (2010 through 2012) made us happy with our decision.  We started wondering about Fisher-Price's commitment to maintaining quality during the course of 2013, deciding to say Amen to it by the end of that year (and the downward spiral's continued since then, unfortunately... totally plasticized so-called diecasts, flimsy playsets, cheaper packaging, etc.)  BUT - we don't regret for a minute the investment we made while the line was top notch!  Having added two more grandsons since then, we know this collection will log plenty more playing time prior to boxing it all up for the attic, while we wait for our great grandkids to arrive!  Although our oldest grandson's outgrown his Thomas phase (he's in 2nd grade now), there've been plenty of times he'll come over for a visit and haul out out all of the different track pieces, using that great imagination of his (he plans to be a structural engineer/designer one day!) to create elaborate track layouts for his younger brother.  Hopefully you can still get some of the older train models at a decent price - if so, we highly recommend this line and all of the terrific interaction it provides with a youngster!The yearly Take-n-Play Collector Checklist included with some (not all) products typically features the most recent products, leaving anyone who would be interested in starting a collection (or even those just interested in finding out about various options from the past) in the lurch as far as what's available in this line.  If you'd like to find out all of the playsets in the line since its inception, I'll list them in the comments section below (oldest - and I might add, highest quality! - playsets first).10/25/16 update:  I'm going back and adding this update to each of my Take-n-Play reviews, since it's important information for any parents/grandparents out there with a young Thomas & Friends enthusiast who holds a special place in their heart, and is considering beginning a collection for them.  I just found out the TnP line of diecast trains/vehicles/rolling stock with magnetic connectors is being REPLACED by Fisher-Price in 2017 with a diecast line called Thomas & Friends Adventures, which will be TnP models modified with PLASTIC HOOK & LOOP COUPLERS.  Obviously, your youngster will not be able to connect the 2014-2016 TnP models (with their flat, round 1-way magnetic connectors), nor the 2010-2014 TnP models - or Learning Curve's compatible 2002-2010 Take Along models - with their protruding 2-way magnetic connectors - with the new types of couplers as of next year.2/17/17 Update:  Fisher-Price must've received a slew of complaints from Take-n-Play owners, because they've now developed magnetic clip engine connectors (to clip onto the magnetic trains - but ONLY those with the flat round 1-way magnets... they don't want to invite comparisons between the high quality of the older trains with protruding 2-way magnets! - that have a plastic hook & loop coupler to be able to connect to the new Adventures engines), along with track adapter pieces (Take-n-Play track pieces/sets have only 1 male or female part at the end to connect up to other track/sets, while the new Adventures tracks/sets have both one male & 1 female part on EACH end), available by directly contacting F-P.

B0043RS8D2,"[CLS] No lie, this is what the dog said as it shook it's head and played some nondescript music:Storytime.  Ant on mat. Nat on ant on mat. Cat on nat on ant on mat. Rat on cat on nat on ant on mat. Bat on mat. Tap, tap, tap.  No rat or cat or nat on ant on mat. No mat.Watch the video.  All the songs build on the same words.  While I respect their intent to create their own music, neither tunes nor lyrics are interesting.Granted I'd just as soon watch endless episodes of My Mother the Car as see Yo Gabba Gabba that the twins love, but I don't think this dog is going to keep their attention.The dog itself is fine and the way it's head and mouth moves will intrigue them.  The dog seems solidly built, is a nice size and is soft and cuddly looking. But why in heaven's name did they program it with such a stupid story?The 10 songs it came with were equally lame.  You can go to smartyants dot com to see other stories and songs you can download to your dog for $25 for 3 months or $50 for a year.I think LeapFrog missed an opportunity to have a great toy here by choosing media and content that parents will find annoying.I gave the toy to the twins (see photo).  They played with it for about five minutes and then went back to much older toys a counting horse, pom poms and baby dolls.It's now been over a month since I gave the dog to the twins and they have totally lost interest - refuse to play with it at all.  Even their 1 year old brother isn't interested.  I still keep it around because I think it's cute.  Maybe I'll take it to work. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Quick Update 12/26/10 - The Smarty Ants programmers have a few tricks up their sleeves. When we loaded the program last week, the house scene in the program was decked out for the holidays, complete with a decorated tree. I'm sure there will be more surprises as the seasons change and other holidays arrive. Very clever! My daughter was impressed!************************First of all, this dog is just the add-on reinforcement for the product that is really an online learning system. I use the word system because it is more than one game or activity, it is an entire world of phonics and learning.Before I go into the product itself, I have to say that Smarty Ants is a newly formed company. They go ABOVE AND BEYOND to help and get you the most out their Smarty Ants learning system. They seem to truly believe in their product and hope to get it in the hands of as many children as possible so that they can benefit from using it.Going back to the dog. The Reading Pup is just they physical add-on to the Smarty Ants system. The pup is soft and cute but does have a hard bottom that houses the mechanical parts. The dog plugs into your computer's USB port only for the purpose of downloading songs and stories for it to retell later on. It does not interact while your child is using the Smarty Ants program. When it is disconnected, it sings, has an animated head and mouth and talks. My 6 year old daughter loved it even before we started on the software.Now for the Smarty Ants program. You MUST have a great internet connection to utilize the program. Once you register, you download an installer (about 56 MB). Then you launch the installer and it begins downloading the first of about 6 packets of software/program files. Some packets are 60 MB or so and one was over 350 MB. This is only an issue if you are on dial-up or satellite internet (like me). If you are a satellite user, you are often restricted by a Fair Access Policy that limits the amount of downloads you can do in a period of time. I did find a way around this (with the help of Smarty Ants customer service) but it could be an issue for other satellite users. I think that Smarty Ants is working on an installer disk but at this time it is not available. So, prepare to do a lot of downloading.Your child picks an ant to represent them on screen. Then they pick friends and name their dog. You do not need a physical dog to use the program but it is a nice add-on. Then they begin with a reading test. It may be that your child is just learning letters or maybe they are up to words with a silent 'e' on the end or consonant blends. The program uses a fun game to place them and begin their journey in the program.Their ant begins in their 'home' with virtual furniture, an outside, bookshelves, and a clothes closet (in case they want to change what their ant is wearing). The type of lessons vary and the more they play, the more 'games' or lesson styles open up. Again, the more they play, the more their personal library of songs and books develops. These can then be downloaded to the reading pup for use without the computer.The animation is top notch. It is smooth, very three dimensional and engaging. The ants are fun to watch and have a variety of secondary characters, like a flea that demonstrates the task at hand. There is lot of encouragement and repetition.My overall impression is really good. I think if your child is a good reader and knows most sight words for first grade, they may be a little bored. But if your child is preschool or kindergarten, just learning letters or starting on sight words, then there is a ton to work with.Keep in mind, you MUST have a subscription to continue to use the program. You can test it out with a free two week trial subscription to see if it is the kind of thing your child has an interest in. If you purchase the reading pup, you get a one month free subscription. After that it is $24.99 for three months or $49.99 for a year. If you put that in perspective, how much would you spend on a Leapster plus phonics games? How about some of the Leapfrog products?My opinion is this, Smarty Ants may not be perfect yet in their installation or execution but they are working super hard to improve their product every day (literally) to respond to consumer issues or comments. Their system is well-thought out and should prove beneficial for many children. Not every child will respond to this kind of learning so my recommendation is to do the two week trial and see for yourself how much your child remains engaged. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I was very excited to give this to my 5-year-old who is in Kindergarten this year and just starting to read. He's schooled at home and Phonics had been his least favorite subject for most of this first quarter due to the lack of hands on learning. He's a very visual and kinesthetic learner and all the verbal lessons weren't helping him absorb the information. When I was given the opportunity to try out the Phonics Pup, it couldn't have come at a better time. Out of the box, the pup is very cute and surprisingly, very soft and cuddly. His mouth moves as he talks and sings, but his upper body also moves around. For something with so many moving parts, being cuddly at the same time is a rarity that I appreciate because it takes him beyond a learning toy and becomes a comforting playmate at the same time.Right out of the box he was ready to go with batteries included. We read through the book and found we had to play a game with the software to determine my son's level and after a few minutes of play, the game alerted us to plug in the pup and download the new information based on my son's score. It downloaded some new songs and stories, which were very similar to the original ones but had some new words and concepts. As my son progresses through the games, it automatically determines when the pup is ready for another update and lets me know via an icon in the upper right of the game selection screen. I just plug him in and the game lets me know when he's done so I can unplug him. My son can continue playing while this is happening, which is a nice feature. I've actually noticed my son has taken to updating the pup all by himself. He plugs in the included USB cable whenever he is prompted to and knows to wait until it's ready. Slick!That said, I don't feel the pup really adds a whole lot to the whole routine. The Smarty Ants game is really fantastic all on it's own, and as I understand, you can subscribe to it whether you've purchased the pup or not. I noticed when we were setting up our account we had the choice of not choosing a pup at all. In the game, my son sees a pup just like the plush one he has. The pup is always with him, cheering him on, helping him, making him laugh. I think this is the primary purpose of the pup, to simply add a companion to the learning process. The songs and stories he sings are repetitive, but a lot of learning Phonics is repetition. The songs aren't necessarily catchy, but my son has learned them just the same and sings along. He is deriving some benefit from it for sure, I'm just not sure the benefit is worth the price of the pup. The stories, as another reviewer mentioned, are not the kind of stories you would read to your child for entertainment. But, they ARE the types of stories your child can actually read independently at this stage of their learning, which is just as important. While it may seem boring to us, to a 5-year-old just learning to read, being able to read along and understand the words, is a real feeling of accomplishment and goes hand in hand with a traditional kindergarten phonics curriculum.So while the pup is cute and cuddly and does offer some bits and pieces of learning opportunities, I wish they paired him up with a 3-month subscription to the Smarty Ants game. If they did this, it would be a no brainer for any parent out there with a child learning to read. With the price of the pup plus the monthly subscription fee, it feels a little bit like I'm being nickel and dimed. Also, I was very disappointed to note that the free trial card you receive with the pup does NOT give you one month free, but only two weeks. In all honesty, I will probably subscribe because my son really enjoys playing the game and it has without question enhanced his kindergarten curriculum. It presents all the same information that I am from my teacher guide, but in a way that he can absorb and enjoy at the same time. It's giving him the confidence to take risks when he's reading, rather than shying away from words he's not sure about. It's given him the skills to sound out any word he sees and he is loving it. I am bursting with pride at my new little reader and I thank Smarty Ants for helping us getting over this hill and helping him enjoy reading rather than fear it. :) [SEP]"",""[CLS] <div id=video-block-R3KUO1TNPFXFX7 class=a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block></div><input type=hidden name= value=https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1rs1x28RPS.mp4 class=video-url><input type=hidden name= value=https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81S80PibgKS.png class=video-slate-img-url>&nbsp;I got this toy for my 18 month old, which is obviously a little young, but I thought I might was well start her on phonics now.  He's actually a really great toy.  He's soft enough for her to carry around like a normal stuffed animal.  He comes pre-programmed with about 8-10 different songs and stories, which are the lowest level of phonics.  If you want him to meet your child's level, you simply plug him into the computer (with the mini-USB cable he comes with) and go to the Smarty Ants webpage.  The webpage allows your child to create a group of avatars, adopt a dog that looks like theirs, and play games so that the dog can be loaded with the educational content that fits your child.  It's really easy to get around the webpage, the games are fun, and even my 18 month old enjoyed the music and stories.  His songs are creative and the synchronization between his words and movement is flawless!  There is no need to turn him on or off, he has a musical note on one paw and a book on the other and when your child pushes one of the buttons, he does the corresponding thing-also, if the button is pushed to start the singing/story and then pushed again in the middle of it, he stops (which is ALWAYS a nice feature when you've heard the same song a million times and need a quick break!!) The battery life is good (about 1 month, used 15+ mins a day) per set of 3 AAs.There are a few reasons I gave him 4 instead of 5 stars, the first is he only comes with a 30 day trial of the website, after which time you have to pay for it ($24.99 for 3 months or $49.99 for the year).  You can keep whatever you have him loaded with, but obviously can't get any new content without the subscription, which seems a little ridiculous to me, but it's not super expensive, just seems like he would come with a longer trial given his price.  Another thing that's less than great about this toy is that there is no way to wash him.  I was hoping you could slide his outsides off the mechanical/computer part, in order to throw him in the wash, but that's not the case, he can only stand up to light spot cleaning - not something a parent really wants to do.The video shows him singing my favorite song (one that he came pre-loaded with) he goes through the entire alphabet and each sound that each letter makes-I didn't record the whole song (for time sake), but I thought that would give you an idea of not only his movement, but the types of phonics songs and stories he/the webpage have for your child to enjoy.

B0043VRE5Q,"[CLS] There appears to be some confusion regarding these Tangled dolls, be it Rapunzel or Flynn Rider. This is largely due to the different manufacturers. I found that the dolls made by Disney are generally in good condition, look authentic (in relation to the dolls featured in the Tangled movie), and hold up better. This is after I compared some of the Tangled dolls I purchased from Disney with those made by other companies that some of my friends had bought for their children. If you go into those holiday toy stores, there are many knock-off dolls that have the Tangled brand imprinted on the packaging, but a closer look tells you that these are nothing but cheap imitations.Anyway, I purchased some Tangled dolls made by Disney for some of the little ones on my Christmas list. The Disney Tangled Flynn Rider doll is well-made. He wears a felt jacket and belt with a satchel. His arms can be moved, and he is poseable. In addition, there are two accessories. One is a mini crown and another is a larger crown with a comb attached to it (so it can be placed on a child's hair). The doll is about 12 inches in height. This is a great doll for your money, but please be aware when ordering as there are many other Tangled dolls out there not made by Disney. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My daughter is a gigantic fan of the movie Tangled. She had some dolls of the princess, and kept using other stuff to pretend they were Flynn.

(Rapunzel was a different story, they later recalled her due to her hair, they have a different version for sale now and replaced her, so kudos to their excellent customer service!)  He is a very solid doll, as handsome in real life as he is in film, and his clothes are accessories are just as dashing as he!  This man really makes the rounds around the dollhouse!  He is the Rico Suave of the toybox, quite the player behind Rapunzel's back in the playroom, let me tell you, the Barbie's and Moxie's and Brats and Monster High girls really fight over Eugene and could care less about the other boys on the block!  Ella just adores her Flynn Rider doll, and the horse he rode in on, she asked for these two repeatedly for her birthday (she had never been so hooked on a movie before so boy, did I indulge her), and he just rides all over the land on his big white horse rescuing maidens, via my daughter, I don't even think she realizes she's pimping him out and that she's making him cheat on Punzie, lol.  But all in all, so cute, that way she plays with her boy doll.  The boots are very cool, I must say, his whole outfit is so very authentic, and I especially love his sash with the crown in it, and the matching one for Ella, she adored that!  MY only drawback, and I say MINE, because it didn't bother my daughter at all, is that he has plastic hair.  I would have loved a Flynn with real hair.  Yes, it looks JUST like him.  But all the girls have real hair, wouldn't we HATE plastic hair on them?  Why can't HE have real hair?  It's MY quirk, not my daughters, and she's more than happy with him, so he gets nothing short of 5 stars on this site and Disney.

Great product. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 3 year old daughter received this as a gift Saturday.  She is CRAZY about Starlight Sparkle.  It's a very likable toy.  My only complaint is that the little gate on the basket of the hot air ballon falls off often.  I know my daughter is too young for this toy but still, it's very annoying.  Other than that, the sound quality is great, even though it's top heavy and my child is very clumsy it has not broken yet.  I am impressed.  The colors are very vibrant as well. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Cute toy. Plays a cute song and has a night light. Is a little loud. Has not broken so that is great! My kids play with it occassionally and it goes with all other Little Pony stuff. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We have 2 of these Balloons~ both my 6 year old and 3 year old have one.  The older child is meh about actually playing with her balloon (that's just how she is~ she likes stuffed animals and dolls more than action stuff.)  She uses it every single night as a night light on the top bunk.  It casts a very soft, yet surprising ample amount of light in either dark pink or a lavender/blue color.  The 3 year old is another story.  This toy is in bed with her on the bottom bunk, downstairs with her in the morning, and every other time in between.Now, I have read about complaints that the door pops off.  Yes it does.  Often.  But it is easily replaced each time, as long as no one misplaces it.  That is the only reason I knocked of 1/4 of a star.  Other than that, the Balloon has survived a rough and clumsy 3 year old's daily play for the past 4 months.  We've never changed the batteries in either one, and as I said before, these Balloons are used daily.  The way we can tell these Balloons apart is that the pink and yellow trim on them is switched.  We didn't try that~ it's just how the second one arrived... thankfully!Our Balloons have Twilight Sparkle with BANGS (a very important aspect to the FIM fans) with an adorable Spike the Dragon.  It also has a clip-on telescope that can be moved to different places on Balloon.  There are pegs on the edge of the basket and on the top of the Balloon for Spike to fit onto (like the Ponies, he has a hole in his foot to fit onto the accessories.)  There is also a handle that can retract on top of the toy, so it can be swung about to fly.There are 3 settings for this Balloon.  One as a night light, where it turns on to a very abbreviated portion of the show's theme song.  The second two are pretty neat for play.  The versions of the songs are different and longer; the Balloon blinks and flashes in time with the melodies.  The music is not annoying at all for a toy...  it's rather lilting and pretty for such an inexpensive thing.This Balloon is definitely a great addition to any girl's MLP collection.  And I really feel like it would get 5 stars, if only the dang door would stay on.  Such a small inconvenience to the tons of fun and use my girls get from these Balloons!  We have most of these Pony play sets and accessories, and this is definitely the best and most popular one.  (In fact, my 3 year old and I were shopping, and there was a display of Pony stuff on a table.  She begged for a second Balloon, lying quietly in the middle of the aisle floor, like a Buddist monk, protesting my answer of No.:) [SEP]"",""[CLS] My six-year-old daughter loves MLP, and especially enjoys the cartoon series which is currently being shown on the Hub channel. She also loves playing with the pony toys and the playsets. We've only recently begun collecting the toys and playsets and this was one of the bigger MLP toys I've purchased for her.The set comes with the balloon which is a nice size and can squeeze in two ponies at most; there's Twilight Sparkle, Twilight's little friend and companion Spike the Dragon; and a telescope that can be clipped to the side of the balloon or on top. The balloon comes with batteries (if in need of replacement, the set requires 3 AAA batteries). In addition, one of the highlights of this toy is that the balloon lights up and plays music (I didn't think the music was too loud, but it all depends. If played repeatedly, the same tune can become annoying!). The balloon also has a night-light mode which delighted my daughter!This is a wonderful addition to any MLP fan's collection and will provide many delightful hours of playtime! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I'm really splitting this review into two.As a toy, this is great.  It's cute to look at, durable, and has provided my daughter with a lot of imaginative play.  Worth buying just for the play mode.As a Night Light, it leaves a lot to be desired.  When you press the button, it has an extremely loud chime.  Maybe not so bad if you press it at the start of bed time, but really loud if you try to turn it on again as your child is drifting to sleep.And you will have to press the button again, unless you are blessed with a child who falls asleep in seconds.  The light does not stay on very long and I usually have to press it about three times before my daughter falls firmly asleep.The colors are pretty though and the glow is lovely in a dark room.So the four stars are really for the toy aspect - just don't count on it as a wonderful Night Light.

B004478GDS,"[CLS] Son (7) got this as a present. He loves it. He was able to build it almost completely by himself. I only had to point out 2 or 3 times something he missed, and helped him with the doors of the cargo-bay (which is a bit tricky). I also helped him with the landing gear.One thing I miss in this set, is some kind of space-tool for the astronaut to hold in his hands on his outer-space trips. Also, I find Lego is an excellent technical-toy, for kids, and to help them with fine motoric-skills, but as a toy to play with it's a bit tedious for young kids, as parts keep coming apart. With this set, it's the top of the cargo-bay, and the elevator-flaps at the end of the wings. Our son was very happy once the shuttle was complete, and started to play with it, but things started to get a bit complicated when the top of the cargo-bay would come of all the time. I solved this problem for him, using a little bit of glue (only for the parts that would keep coming off). I imagine this must be a complete NO-NO for Lego-fans,... but this way he can play with it without getting discourage, and will try another lego set.It's also very educative. I asked if he knew what the satelite was for,... he told me he thinks that's for television. I was surprised, .. it could be indeed a TV satelite,... I figured he must have seen something like it in one of the TV show he watches. Then I told him, the shuttle really exists, and the questions really started. What's this for? What's that for?... can it get close to the sun? Cool. I'm planning to get online, show him some pictures, and videos.All by all, this is a very nice set, cool toy, educational, and easy to build.

Definitely go out and pick up this Space Shuttle! The design is very sturdy, so you can actually PLAY with this model without fear of constantly breaking off parts and pieces. It's a reasonably priced item so it makes a great gift for a Lego fan (or aviation nut).Couple of notes in terms of the build itself:1. This is a 'modular' build---pieces sorted into numbered bags so you don't have to fish around so much finding what you need.2. The instructions do not show a parts list on each page as many Lego sets do. In essence, the builder has to look at the previous page and the current page to determine what has changed and then choose and place the pieces accordingly. This might be a little challenging for novice builders but the ship is pretty straightforward so it's not a dealbreaker. If you end up with too many leftover parts, though, you probably missed a few steps!I had no issues with the instructions or the photos in the set. Once constructed, the crane arm and satellite stowed correctly with the doors shut. I got this whole model together in less than 15 minutes, and then we got right to playing.

The 2011 truck has more detail, such as the search light, the newer accessories; an orange dirt bike, cash sack, coffee mug, megaphone, radio, barricade, handcuffs, money, road blocking sign thingy, yellow storage bin. Now one thing I noticed was that there is a separation point between the storage area and the prisoner hold, unlike the 2008 fire truck. When we look at the 2008 model prisoner truck, the prisoner hold was bigger, more capacity for more prisoners to be transported. To fix this though, take out the 1x4 doors, move the prison bars two studs (the other side should have two studs of room as well), stack three 2x1 thick bricks (x4) and fill them in the remaining spaces, an rearrange roof tiles as well. One more thing is this set does not need to be only a prisoner transport set, it can also serve as a police van, and by that I mean it could respond to a traffic accident and block roads and keep everyone safe.I will also point out details between the two sets. The 2011 model has a fully functional search light, less space in the prisoner hold, more accessories, lookes more Eropean than the 2008 model, lego has improved on detail with this set, has a light in the entrance way of the prisoner hold.Pros.*more detail**more accessories**worth $20.00**more of a European style**easy build**minifigures**the truck itself**etc.*Cons.You have to tear off the roof to get the officer inStickersVehicle Can only fit one driver inside.Pick this police set up today if my review is convencing enough. [SEP]"",""[CLS] this is another lego product review for me.  the police prisoner transport is lots of fun!  the pieces are assembled into detailed articles.  first, the quality of lego products is excellent AND, in my growing experience, very highly reliable.  the assembly process is quite manageable for my 8 year old.  this was my / our first experience in putting together a lego item with wheels!  i had a little trepidation, but it was just a matter of click click click click done.  the colors are bright and cheerful.  the whole set draws you, ok, i confess, me, to want to play with it.  don't!!!  i've been gluing the items my son / I want to play with.  basically, i glue the stationary pieces so they don't fall apart, but i leave unglued those elements (e.g., doors) that are designed for movement.  THAT makes playing with these lego products lots of fun without fearing total collapse every time we get them out to play.  ummm, i recommend first assembling it in it's entirity.  look it over and make certain that you constructed it perfectly before you glue it.  you might even take it apart and re-assemble it so you know where things go.  i suggest that because once you glue a lego, it's hard to take it apart and try again.  i give everything that i review a grade.  for quality, enjoyment, bonding, ease ... i give it an A+.  i recommend this lego set for anyone collecting city scenes, police, or just legos in general.  in my opinion, these pre-determined sets are not all that great for public organizations ... it might be assembled once, then a piece goes missing and the next person can't build the piece because the foundation piece is missing.  the lego sets that inspire imagination rather than construction / imitation might be best in public settings.  this is great for the home and i highly recommend it.

There are many unique parts associated with this item but overall, it's a nice toy kit.  I would not hesitate to recommend it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My kids and I enjoy building with Legos almost on a daily basis. So I was intrigued to see how the Technic line differed from the traditional bricks. Wow!! Completely different but just as much fun! If you've never played with Technic models, it's more like joints and pipes vs. bricks. In fact, this model comes with a total of five traditional brick pieces (nine if you include the wheels). Most are pivot points, connectors, and gears. Which makes this a completely different experience. Instead of building structures or vehicles, you're building machines with working gear parts. Very cool.The picture shows the one (main?) model designed to be built with this kit: the dump truck. Assembled, it's a tough looking truck with a turning gear knob on top that lowers the dump. It's a pretty cool design in that the dump doesn't dump but is almost lowered similar to how a small dumpster is lowered (where it stays fairly parallel the whole time). And the dump part is actually not attached, making it seem even more like one of those dumpster delivery trucks. Putting this together, then seeing how the parts interact was both enjoyable and entertaining.I haven't built the second model - the pickup truck (actually, it's more like a towtruck with forks in the rear) - but it looks like it employs a similar mechanism for lowering the backend.The model doesn't feel quite as solid as the brick-based models, but it seems like it would hold up to a lot of play.

With young kids, you may need to guide them through the build, but this is really a great opportunity to help teach them about turning a plan into something real. It is a good spatial reasoning exercise. The models typically exhibit only one or two interesting mechanical principles, but they are simple, sturdy, and easy for little hands to manipulate.This kit's mechanical trick is the ability to hook a container (similar to a British skip lorry) and pull it onto the truck bed.  This is done by turning the knob at the top of the cab which is connected, via gears, to the lift arms.  This is a simple kit, and even though it doesn't have the same wow-factor as Lego's little Technic set from two years ago (the mini-bulldozer), it still has plenty of playability.  The set can also be rebuilt into a tow truck, though I'm not terribly enamored with this b-model.The model is not terribly difficult to build, and because it is held together with pins, it is less prone to parts popping off as occurs on its brick-built cousins. This is a small vehicle, not even large enough to hold a Lego mini-figure, but this never seems to bother my kids. Finally, this kit was introduced as part of Lego's 2011 line and it is among the least expensive of their Technic kits. Lego only produces one or two of these small size Technic sets each year.

After she had caused numerous headaches as I spent way too much time undoing things she had somehow managed to do on my computer, I decided she needed a laptop of her own. I bought five different brands before this one, and she had no interest in any of them. I am assuming it was because they didn't really look like a real laptop.

Only wish i could of found this setup sooner for my 2wd truck.  If you do try to use this setup its best too look on google (thats how i found the setup for my Stampede) to see how it works on the truck,  you do have to cut a small bit of plastic off this Body mount but its nothing a utilty knive cant do.

B0046HLTIA,"[CLS] I had to have this delightful set of dolls, complete with their own home, pets and the cutest clothes imaginable. From leggings to boots and pet accessories, this set is awesome!When I was a young girl, from about six to ten, I played with paper dolls for hours. In those days, the dolls were actually very thin cardboard and the clothes were paper. If I recall correctly the dolls were perforated so we could just snap them off the backing and the clothes were paper with tabs for hanging on dolls' shoulders. I had to cut out the clothes with scissors and, of course, they never fit perfectly. But I didn't care; it was fun and it was normal for those days. My favorites were my Shirley Temple paper dolls.If my parents had brought something like this home to me, I would have thought we were rich! That's how times change...I guess you can tell that I love this set. It not only has four girl dolls that are wooden and stand sturdily on wooden stands, the clothes are attached to the dolls with magnets. No slipping, no sliding... and so cool... The magnets are not too tight, making it easy for your little ones to easily remove and re-dress the dollies. Not only that, but the set comes with cute accessories for the dog and cat too.  How cool is that?With 130 magnetic outfits and accessories, it's like you have your own private Gap store. And the accessories have their own storage box with plastic lid; for easy storing it fits right inside the doll house that consists of two rooms and an attic. Each room is decorated with colorful art...from furniture to curtains...and more.I can't wait for my granddaughter to come visit to play with me and this new toy. Don't tell anyone, but I have already spent hours dressing and re-dressing my new dollies. It's relaxing and fun trying different colorful tops with the really cool tights, boots and other accessories. And the cat (they call it Dandelion) looks so sweet in her big fancy bows. Dandelion is a cute name, but I want my grand-daughter to name the pets herself so they will feel more special to her... As for the dog, well... he's adorable too.As you can tell, I love this entire set! Wish I had something this good when I was a little girl.Very highly recommended. Due to some small pieces, there is a choking hazard warning, so take care when the younger ones are around.Reviewed by Betty Dravis, October 7, 2014Author of The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley [SEP]"",""[CLS] Adorable!! These wooden dolls are very similar in fashion to that of a paper doll. It is completely one dimensional, but the choice of magnetic clothing will keep a little girl busy for hours. It has over 130 pieces with a different variety of clothing style.  It comes with 4 dolls to dress and a pet. The box is on the heavy side because they are real wood pieces.  Wonderful play toy and well worth it! [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a great set with LOTS of extras. The girls are sturdy and the clothes are as well. They are colorful and stick easily to the dolls. The house folds nicely and holds all the pieces.  I did notice that the back of the house is not magnetic, which is kind of a bummer b/c I thought it would be cool/great storage for all the pieces to stick there. Overall, my 5 year old is in heaven with all the ensemble choices.  This has provided hours of great play. [SEP]"",""[CLS] There are other T. S. Shure Daisy Girls dress-up magnetic doll packs, but this 130 piece set combined with a two foot dollhouse is the most complete.  It gets a lot of use here, and appeals to a wide age range.  Our five year old plays with it the most, but her ten year old sister is always happy to pretend play with her.  There are so many interchangeable outfits and they have cute themes--tea party, bedtime, bathtime, swimming--just to name a few.  The magnet clothes and dolls are well made and small fingers have no trouble playing/accessorizing with the pieces.  An additional wardrobe box holds everything if neatly stored, but we find it's much easier to throw all the pieces in a ziploc plastic bag.If you're on a budget, I recommend looking at other dress-up sets, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/T-S-Shure-Best-Friends-Pocket-Dolls-Dress-Up/dp/B0009I6S68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>T.S.

Shure Fashion-A-Belles Wooden Magnetic Dress-Up Dolls</a>.  These smaller sets are more modestly priced around the $15 range, and are just as much fun. The dollhouse in this set is nice, but to be honest, it is pretty shallow (2 1/12 depth) and the girls actually dress up the dolls outside the house more than they pretend play inside it.  The set-up does make a nice backdrop, though, and the kids often include the house in other creative play scenarios that don't include the dress-up dolls.We've never been disappointed with any T. S. Shure toy product.  It's so refreshing to know toys are still made that promote quiet play and use of imagination. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This thing is huge.  Superb quality dress-up dolls with doll house.  You can see in every wooden piece how well made it is.  You say they used to make toys like this - sturdy, made to last, classic.  Remember paper dolls in which you cut the dresses, shoes and hats with scissors, and then attach to the dolls by folding the tabs?  This thing is the magnetic version.  The magnets are strong enough to get the dress and accessories stick on the dolls, but not too strong  that is frustrating to the kids.The prints are fun and cute.  You can dress them up according to the season whether it summer, fall or snowday; special occasions like birthday and tea party, and some outlandish costumes like pirates, space suits.  Also some silly hats and boots . You can also dress up the cat and the dog.Cons:The house is not magnetic so you can't really place the cake and cereal box on top of the table, or hang the clothes. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Love the old school card board cut out dolls that could be stacked up and stored on a flat doll house, you are in for a major treat. This is simply the best of its kind. Made with real wood and magnet you could arrange and re-arrange you doll house with infinite combinations. The magnets are just strong enough to avoid them all clubbing into a big ball. The art work and quality stands miles ahead of the plastic run-in-the-mill dolls that flood the market. Manufacturing quality shines on every level. It is one of those toys that is a must must have for all kids. Worth the price of entry and it provides years of play time.This one just kept growing on us as time went by. The quality of the build and amount of variations possible is just outstanding. It is a large toy too, wood does have its cool wow factor. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I love the house that can be used for both play and storage. Awesome double-duty design! I do wish that the four dolls provided more diversity rather than two pairings of similar looking girls - white redheads and darker skinned girls who look Hispanic.

The dolls also bring a bracelet for your child to wear that says changing the world one heart at a time.These dolls are about 14 inches which in my opinion makes them even easier to carry and dress. All of the hearts for hearts dolls come with a booklet and a story about the doll. These dolls represent real girls from real places all over the world.

Each child comes with a story and a web code, a bracelet for your child, and each purchase donates to children in need through World Vision.There are not enough good things I can say about the Hearts 4 Hearts dolls - they are well made - poseable arms, legs, and head, with hair that's easy to brush/ style. They are much more 'innocent' than the Bratz or Moxie dolls - they kept the outfits trendy without marketing skimpy outfits to young children. And the features and outfits represent other cultures so well!My only complain is that there are very few outfit choices. Each doll has only 1 additional outfit (although we have 3 dolls and 3 additional outfits to mix/ match). Since the standard doll is 18 (these are 14), it's very hard to find clothing that fits them, and there are no additional accessories. However, I would not trade it for the love my daughter feels for these dolls. [SEP]","[CLS] Capture the colorful warmth of Mexico with our Consuelo doll.

He instantly loved this set, and who could blame him?  Let me list the pros and cons, from the parent's point of view.PROS:Great quality pieces.  These can MOSTLY withstand the abuses of a toddler, but will definitely hold up if your child is older and more careful with their toys.Vibrant colorsMultitude of track formations to construct.LOTS of extra pieces such as buildings, people, signs, landscaping: for more imaginative playThe price cannot be beat for what you're getting.CONS:There are two pieces of this set that WILL break if you're not careful.  The railroad crossing has 2 red posts that drop down.  These could easily be broken if stepped on or pulled too hard.  The bridge is VERY fragile.  We had to re-glue one of the sides after it snapped off .Set up of the tracks can be too difficult for a smaller child.Lots of pieces to storeIf you don't have at least 6 feet of play space for this set, either on the floor or tabletop, you may want to find a smaller set.  This looks great, but takes up a LOT of room.  Our goal is to find a child height table that we can permanently have this set up on.This is a great set for the price you pay.  Just take the size and number of pieces into consideration before buying.  Have fun!!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a wonderful train set purchased for a 4-year-old girl.  She enjoys playing with it, as does her 6-year-old brother.  I wanted to give her something different for Christmas besides the usual toys that little girls receive (such as multiple dolls, purses, dress up clothes, jewelry, etc) that teach them nothing about building, spatial relationships, or engineering.  I am very impressed with the high quality of Orbrium Toys. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this for my 3 and 5 year old boys for Christmas and they really love it. We almost purchased the Melissa and Doug brand wooden train set, but found this one instead which was about $40 cheaper for the same amount of wooden pieces. My mom has the M&D brand set, and after we opened this one, I can tell you that this is just as nice as the M&D brand. The pieces are colorful, nicely crafted, and very durable. We also bought the small kit that comes separately so the kids could have extra trains and pieces to play with on the tracks. They absolutely love it and said it's their favorite gift they got for Christmas this year. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I got this for my twins. They are only 18 months but my boy is quite keen on trains. This set is made from solid wood. The pieces are all well made and join together beautifully.  Since this is our first set I have not tested it's compatibility with other major products. But from its size I don't think that will be am issue.The number of tracks itself isn't so many. There are many pieces of shrubs, trees, buildings and people. Though I find it weird that they people are of the same height as the trees and the buildings.But I just got this set as a starter set. So I don't mind that. There is a green and yellow bridge which my son took an exceptional liking to. The reason I gave this four stars is because the bridge broke soon after we received it. Not that there was any rough play involved. Anyway boys will be boys so perhaps that can't be helped. I have managed to glue it back together. The straight tracks are very, very few. So I must warn you that if you are looking to build an alternative track from the one in the picture, not very many are possible.What I did was I expanded on this pack. I was quite pleased with the quality of this track and I did not want to spend an exorbitant amount of money on branded tracks. I got the 58 pieces expansion pack and thus I have the straights I need. I also got the 12 trains set sold separately.  That is a brilliant buy to go with this set.In future I plan to buy the required additions separately...For example the coal mine or the signal station. For now I am pleased with my purchase. And I speak for my son too! (My girl, his twin isn't very keen on trains unfortunately) [SEP]"",""[CLS] I had initially given this toy 5 stars but I am changing it to 3.

It is a pain to keep putting the tape every time we lay the track.Pros:1) Comes in a small easy to store box2) There are many vehicles which also fit on the train track3) Durable4) Entertains my son for long periods5) No irritating lights or sounds that come with most of today's toys [SEP]",[CLS] Brand new in gift set packaging.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a really cute alternative to the standard, plastic shape sorters.  I like it because it looks nice on the toy shelf.  My 8 month old niece likes banging the pieces together.  My 15 month old daughter likes shaking the shapes and trying to fit them in.  My 2 year old likes identifying the shapes and colors.  It's one of those toys that really grows with your child.I marked it down to 4 stars for two reasons: 1) There is some splintering on the wood.  2) Once you have 4-5 pieces in, you can't get another piece through without shaking them around to make room.All in all, I'm really happy with it! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I've been looking for wooden sorter and this is what I was looking for!  Yes, like other reviewers, it's kind of hard to get all those shapes out of the box with the string, but I like the fact that it keeps those shapes well and sometimes my kid uses it as musical instruments shaking this! So we love this.  These various shapes are very useful and we are now learning the colors as well. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I hate this toy, I bought it when my son was maybe 11 months thinking that wood is safer than plastic, well ... First of all the wood was not finished well and there were rough spots I had smooth with a file. This toy is extremely heavy (well, it's wood, go figure!), so if my baby threw it, it could really hurt someone.It's very difficult to get the pieces out, so difficult that I considered cutting the string on one side. In order to the pieces to fit in the actual sorter you have to have the piece your are sorting facing up, otherwise they all get cramped up.It just did not work for me, I would throw it out but for now is just hidden as my baby likes to pick up objects and bang them everywhere. [SEP]"",""[CLS] First, let me say that Hape is quickly becoming my favorite brand for quality wood toys. I'm never disappointed by them.This is no exception-- it's sturdy, colorful, and beautifully finished. The colors are gorgeous and the paint shows no signs of chipping despite some very enthusiastic usage by a 14-month-old boy.We have had no difficulty with fitting all the shapes into the sorter-- when you use the sorter as it was designed to be used (colored pieces up-- the sides are flat for a reason!) there is a natural mixing effect, and the other shapes already in the sorter are moved out of the way. If you're trying to insert the pieces from the side, though, you are probably going to have a problem!I agree with some of the other reviews-- it is a little difficult to get shapes out. I find that holding the elastic to one side and shaking the shapes out of the bottom is the easiest way, though if you're comfortable with it I'd recommend cutting the string out of one side for easier removal.Aside from the removal issue, we really love this toy. I would definitely purchase this again. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I liked the idea of a wooden sorter with pieces that my LO could use as blocks before being able to use the actual sorter. i tried to use the sorter myself and I have to say that once most of the pieces are in the last one have a hard time to fit in, you can push the piece through the right shape but it won't go in because another shape on the other side is blocking it so you have to shake it till it goes through ... Maybe not ideal for kids? Also, the sorter itself had some rough wood patches that I smoothed myself with a coarse nail file. As for getting the pieces out, it may be a little tricky but I thought I could cut open one string (there are strings on both sides) and maybe that would make it easier, haven't done it yet. Also, thissorter is Pretty heavy...Overall ... I am not too impressed with this sorter, wouldn't recommend. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I posted a few pictures of this item to show it's size it is just under 5 inches tall and 6 inches wide.  Despite the small size this item is awesome. Made of good quality wood. Also, unlike Melissa and Doug products this item had no chemical smell to it. I also like that it is made in Switzerland instead of China. I did notice a run in the paint on the yellow block but it does not bother me at all since this product is so well made and painted. The paint is so thick (particularly on the orange moon) that it almost feels like plastic it is so smooth.I spent allot of time researching shape sorters and this one seemed to fit the bill the best. I wanted a wooden one, which obviously this one is (we did not want the Melissa and Doug wooden shape sorter due to a past recall on it due to barium levels in the paint), Wanted one that had more than three shapes and one of the main things I was looking for was one that would be easy for our daughter to get the blocks back out of. This item falls a bit short of the mark on that one. We have not given it to her yet but, I can tell from playing with the item myself that the string is going to be a pain in the butt. I am actually considering cutting the top string so that she can just reach in and grab the blocks back out. I read the review that mentioned this issue...so I was expecting it. I am glad that we chose this one. Not only does it teach shapes, but also colors and the beads are nice for making music with. Well worth the price! [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a great little shape sorter.  It is colorful without being tacky.  I also like the little touches, like the colors matching the shapes and the little beads inside the pieces that make noise when shaken (they don't seem like a hazard unlike some of the other reviewers have stated as the plastic covering seems pretty sturdy).  I got this for my son when he was around 12 months and he is only now (at almost 16 months) starting to understand the concept.  My only complaints are that the paint is starting to chip a bit on some of the pieces and the shapes are a little hard for my son to remove once he inserts them (but, that's part of the challenge of the toy).

It's a game that any age can play, as long as they have a decent understanding of things around the house and their living environment. Some cards do refer to people or things that younger people may not know yet, but they could always pick another card.  There are no inappropriate cards.  Even though it's 'adult', it only refers to the amount of knowledge a person would have.***We bought Adult and original HedBanz, and then the kids could play with each other that way, and the adults could give adult clues for things like 'George Washington' or something.

Hedbanz is a game you want to have in your home to pull out and use whenever you can. It really is a game you can play with a wide variety of ages. There are even easy ways to modify the game if this one is too hard for the younger people in your life. You can always limit the choices to only people or only places etc. to narrow the playing field for less seasoned players. Also, I found it to be a great review/learning tool. You can make your own cards using regular index cards and then use it as a game to go over topics such as: presidents, states, vocabulary and so on. It requires some thinking which is always a good thing. We look forward to hours and hours of fun with this! [SEP]","[CLS] Its Hedbanz for adults. The quick question game of what am I? that leaves everyone guessing. Ask questions to figure out if the card on your head is a person, place or object. But be smart, after all its Hedbanz for adults.

The balls them self are very vibrant and they don't crush easily; even with my grandson stand on some of them.  The price point on these balls, was probably one of the things that made them most attractive after looking at all available here on Amazon.  Many sell for $25+, but I got these for under $15 shipped, the larger balls are only about $5 more.  Overall these are well worth buying and I easily give them 5 stars.

But there is a different twist with these wooden blocks - magnets - not flimsy magnets, but real powerful magnets.  Each block is embedded with a magnet that makes the satisfying clicks every time you put them together.  It is strong enough to make them hold together, but not too strong to squeeze or injure a child's little fingers.The quality of each piece is superb.  It has no sharp edges whatsoever.  Workmanship is fantastic.I have 3 kids (5, 6 and 11 years old) who plays with them for hours.  They also love to bring them in the car.  It is also one of those nerdy toys that is great as an office desk toy, like those bucky magnets or Japanese zen sand boxes.I first wondered what kind of wood they were using to make them. I found the answer from their website.  The wood is called Huesito, also called bonewood,  a kind of hardwood that is light and dense, and often used to make tool handles.  It is not very popular in US, but grows in abundance in Honduras. It has grain patterns that look nice and fairly represented on these toy blocks.The manufacturer makes claim of embracing the green movement and protecting the environment. Their have a mission of helping the poor section of Honduras whence they manufacture these toys, creating jobs and putting street kids to school.  One tree can harvest 500 sets of toy blocks, and for every block set they sell, they plant 12 new trees helping reforestation in Honduras.Cons:At the time of this review, I wish that they can bring down the prices so that more kids will have a chance to play with them.

These ones are slightly smaller and slightly thinner than other wooden magnet doll sets I've seen.I think they're a great size.  Everything fits in the travel bag, which easily stores both dolls and all their clothes.  It has a double snap closure and handle.This School Days themed set has 40 pieces of clothing/accessories.  The outfits are cute and stylish, yet age appropriate and modest.  Being school themed, it includes outfits such as soccer uniform, art smock, graduation gown, cheerleading uniform, and school clothes.The magnets are strong enough, so the clothes stick well to the dolls.My kids love the combining options of the outfits.  The varied clothing fosters imaginative play--my kids like to create silly outfits and costumes, as well as invent scenes and activities revolving around the clothing choices.Wonderful Toy! [SEP]"",""[CLS] This set of wood paper dolls is adorable.  The clothes are held on by a layer of magnetic material on the doll and the clothes.  These are fun to play with with the grandkids and should last for a long time where traditional paper dolls don't last very long at all when put into the hands of a young child.I like the plastic carry case that comes with the set but it is less durable than the actual dolls.  It is nice to store the pieces but I will be looking for something a little stronger. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I like this set much better than the farm set. There are more clothing options and accessories. The same minor flaws apply though, the case is cheap plastic that isn't quite big enough. The magnets are somewhat weak, so a child will need to learn to not bounce the dolls around, or else the clothing and accessories will slide off the doll. It is not made of wood in the sense you might think. It is a particle board-like substance that is thicker and sturdier than paper or cardboard, but it can still be bent and torn if handle too roughly. Overall, your little girl is in for hours of fun imaginative dress up play. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My granddaughter likes this set which ultimately weighs in heavily in my evaluation of this product. I think this is a fairly nice set but by no means perfect. Instead of paper dolls, this is a more functional playset that is somewhat sturdy and offers many configurations of outfits. They are brightly colored and kid cute. I used to love paper dolls despite all their deficiencies and the grandkid seems to be just as enthusiastic when it comes to this type of toy.The negatives? While the magnets appear to work, the play pieces (interchangeable clothing and accessories) are somewhat thin and flimsy when compared to other manufacturers products. We already have a few Melissa and Doug sets and they are sturdier and also better packaged. This comes in a cheap plastic bag which won't hold up for long but should ideally because you will want to have packaging to contain the entire set.However, when I look at the set in its entirety it seems like a nice set given its price. It will provide many hours of creative playtime and might be passed down to another child. Overall, on creativity alone this is 4* and will delight most little girls. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I got these dolls for my three year old granddaughter and she loves them. They are already to be dressed in school items and she loves to carry them around in this plastic bag. I wish the magnets were stronger because the clothes seem to fall off if you jiggle them too much. They are a little thin but work well for younger children. I just wish you could stand them up by themselves. Still my granddaughter has gotten a lot of pleasure from them. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 5 year old really likes this set. It comes with 2 cute wooden dolls and 40 assorted pieces including tops, bottoms, shoes and accessories. The pieces are nice quality and not paper thin like some others.

Their underclothes are camis and panties(as opposed to the bra on Emily). The girls have a layer of metal in them, and the clothes are magnetic, so they stick right on.I complained a bit about the Emily set not having storage, and while this one does, it's kind of crappy. The bag is plastic, and I don't expect it to last long at all. It does have plenty of room for extras, though.

Just a bit bigger than polly pockets. Their legs swing freely, heads bobble, and their arms can be twisted. Just very cute. Seem very well made and durable. The ferris wheel you spin yourself and it has seat belts and the dolls legs hang out holes in the front of each basket but their legs don't swing while in there. The ferris wheel is alright but my girls just had to have every doll so the doll was worth it itself! They were their favorite toy this Christmas! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I ordered this as both a birthday gift for my 3 y.o. and as a cake topper for the cake I made her.  This toy looks exactly as shown in the picture with the included accessories.  The tea cups have small elastic straps to keep the dolls in place; however they are too difficult for my 3 y.o. to use independently-her fine motor skills are not at that level yet.  My 6 y.o. helps her put the dolls in place.  Both of my daughters have enjoyed playing with their mini Lalaloopsy toys imaginatively with this prop.  Also, this toy fit nicely on a 9 inch round layer cake-making an easy cake display. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This thing is just too cute!  Yes you have to turn the ferris wheel yourself, but that's part of the fun.  It comes with one doll, and the others are paperdolls to fill in the seats.  I got a great deal as it was on a Lightning deal.  Someone is going to be happy opening this gift!  My 6 yr old granddaughter thought it was so cute and played with it (still inside the box) until I told her it was time to wrap.  It's REALLY cute! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Overall this is a very cute toy and lalaloopsy fans will like it. There are however a few things that could be improved upon. 1. While I like that there are seat belts which shows kids how important safety is...they really don't work too well with the dresses on the lalaloopsy dolls. Younger girls will likely have a tough time getting the dolls into and out of the seat belt. 2. Dolls with bigger feet such as the new costume dolls are a real challenge to get in and out of the seats as the foot hole is nearly too small. 3. This toy would be more fun if there was a hand crank to turn it on the side...or better yet if it were battery operated. I would be willing to pay a bit more for a battery operated ferris wheel. 4. Lastly, it would be nice if the ferris wheel had more seats to acccomodate more dolls. Now, I should probably mention some good things about it :). 1. The details are very well done. I like that the lalaloopsy dolls and the playsets show attention to detail. 2. The plastic seems to be fairly durable...but we did just buy it so I cannot attest to it's durability over time. If you are thinking about buying this I would say go for it. It's a cute toy. However, it is not worth more than twenty dollars. If I were to put a dollar amount on it ... I would say twelve would have been ideal. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Do the makers of these toys test them to see if they work properly?  Do they even give a damn?  I'm horrified by the poor quality of cheaply made toys these days - as a parent, it is one of my biggest frustrations - but of course kids are drawn to these bright, colorful things that are well-advertised and designed to be attractive.  I have to assume that more often than not, the toy makers are not counting on children actually playing with these things.My 5 1/2-year-old daughter used her own saved money to purchase this toy.  She was so excited, as she'd been coveting it for quite some time.  Turned out to be a huge disappointment, and a source of frustration, rage, and tears.  The ferris wheel is squeaky.  One of the teacup seats does not move with ease.  The little LaLaLoopsies are nearly impossible to secure in the seats:  tough to force their feet through the hole, and tougher to get that stupid little piece of elastic around their bodies (even I had difficulty accomplishing this).  The location of the stairs makes no sense.  I'm sure once we have it for a few more days I will find other things wrong with it as well - although I am trying to convince my daughter to return the cheap, poorly made, piece of garbage.Caveat emptor! [SEP]"",""[CLS] This Ferris Wheel is awesome!  I can't believe reading these other reviews about it, complaining that it doesn't run on batteries (like wasting $$$, do you?), doesn't make noise (I say, Thank God!) and is flimsy!  My 2 older girls have played with this Ferris Wheel almost daily for over a year now, and they still love it, it is still in great shape and my girls have never once complained that it is quiet and manual.The seat belts don't just go over the legs~ that's why others have had issues with the dolls falling out.  The belt is ment to go over the skirt.  It fits snugly, and the dolls can go record speeds without flinging out.  My now 6 year old never had a problem with this, after I showed her how to put the dolls in.  My now 3 year old still has some issues, but she can put her miniature My Little Ponies in the seat belts with no problem!I love that this playset is reminiscent of older toys of yesteryear, and I love that my daughters find it interesting and fun. Don't be swayed by these negative reviews~ this Ferris Wheel is one of the better mini Lala sets you can buy! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I just bought this ferris wheel for my daughter who turns 6 tomorrow, and is very much into pretend playing/role playing with dolls, etc.I was worried when I read one of the reviews here that said that the dolls fall off the ferris' cups, so I opened my daughter's present! (I did not want her opening it tomorrow and being all dissapointed).Here's the trick:  the lalaloopsy dolls have a wide skirt which makes it difficult to put through the elastic belt in the cups, however, as long as you stretch the belt enough to go over the dolls' skirt- NOT JUST THE LEGS- it holds the dolls very snuggly and cute!  This took but 10 seconds.  Just have to pull/stretch the belt first, and then put the doll through it, all the way up to waist.  The cups also have a hole where the legs slide into.The ferris wheel itself turns (manually) without any problems .  I see my girl having lost of fun with this!

[SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a super fun game, and addicting too. I bought this for my 16 year old niece for Christmas as she could not get enough during Thanksgiving. It is simple, frustrating and fun all at the same time. Each player has a stack of cards, then you take 3 in one hand and use your other hand to lay down. There are no turns you basically have to think fast if you can lay down your card before the other player, the problem is it can be a number, dice, fingers or just tally marks so you really have to think. I loved playing it with my niece and we had a blast, we were laughing so hard at the end because we both kept messing up. My nine year old can play too just not as fast, but still super fun, great for anyone 8 and above. My 6 almost 7 year old can do it but gets frustrated quickly. Me and my husband have had some pretty fun battles too!! Highly Recommended!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] After you play a round, you have to sort all 170-some odd cards back into their separate color piles. I believe there are 5 colors. The pack they come in does not sort them into their separate colors but rather stacks them into three stacks. Each time you store the cards you have to pile the different colors together and them sort them out again when you play. Get some rubber bands! For a game where color is such an important factor, they could have sold the game where the packaging better supported the separation of colors. The game is crazy to play. My kids like it but my younger one gets so lost in watching the other people play crazy that he forgets to lay stuff down or doesn't get things laid down in time. Not sure on the weird scoring. We just counted the total number of piles completed by each person and gave them that number of points. Otherwise the scoring was complicated enough to keep the kids from being interested in playing. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I won't go into a great deal of detail on this but suffice it to say that our kids have enjoyed this as an alternative to Blink which they have played out.

The butterflies are adorable and it's a really nice spin on the classic puzzle.  The carrying case is very convenient for storage.  This is great for working on colors and shapes - and would be fun to use in the bathtub even.

He has some fine motor skill issues and he has been able to pinch the tweezers, although he doesn't necessarily pick things up with them due to this problem (not quite strong enough to keep the tweezers closed). But I actually liked the tweezers just to help develop his skills. The magnifying glass has gone through a lot and it's held up pretty well except for the little stand, which broke off.

There is a ring on the back of the magnifying glass that will pop out so it can stand up, but he really hasn't been interested in that so we just leave it closed.  The glass does magnify much more than the last one he had and he loves being able to blow up pictures, words, and faces to make them look huge!  My 1 year old has even gotten in on the action and picks it up to look at things.  The glass, which is more of an acrylic, does scratch easily though.

So far we've used these several times and they're working just fine. I imagine that they would work well for other games as well.

B004DJ66EI,"[CLS] My 20 month old granddaughter is fascinated by these elephants. There are ten elephants, five large and five small. They have colors of different hues and are very cute. You can link the tails to the trunk and form a line or circle. It is a great novelty to learn how to count and to learn colors.But, what my granddaughter really loves is the big gallon container the elephants come in. The top has a handle, so it is easy for a little girl to carry. She loves to open the top, empty the elephants out, then put the elephants back in and put the top back on. She lifts up the handle and carries the container from room to room. She learned how to connect the elephants but they do not snap,and she stops to try to connect and disconnect on her trips from room to room. What I am reminded of is the commercial for the work out gym, where the hulk is being interviewed and when asked what he does, he says I lift things up and put them down. My granddaughter has him beat, she doesn't need to say it, she shows us!There was a slight odor when the container was opened, so I washed the elephants, the container and the lid. All is sweet and ready for the girl. This is a gift for a child who loves to discover and innovate for herself.

They are very durable and my girls also love to play with them in addition to using them as a teaching tool. I highly recommend them!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] We're learning numbers here, and I got these for her to play with at her grandparents'.  The elephants are cute, reminds me of Dumbo for some reason.  However, they don't snap together...you just hook them together, nose to tail.  And the numbers don't coincide with the color of the elephant either (I guess the point is to make sure the number is recognized, and not to just rely on the color matching?).  You can't really hook them together and slide them around in a line either, since the end of the chain will topple over, but I guess that's not really the aim of this toy.  Mine likes to sort them by size, and match by color, and is recognizing the numbers (6 and 9 still confuse her, but at least there's a line on those to indicate the bottom of the number).  If they actually snapped and could balance better, I'd give it 5 stars.  They are however, easy to clean, and I like that they all fit inside the container they come in. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My two year old loves elephants and this toy definitely appeals to him. The storage bucket is great, and the handle makes it fun for little ones to carry around.  He cannot open this by himself, but he can close it, and the handle does come off pretty easily as he tries to muscle it open.  The elephants themselves are bright and sturdy and are well coded in size, color, and number, and so it is a great learning tool and would be nice for a preschool center station. Right now he is just beginning to get the concept of number sequence, and mostly just plays with these a few at a time for pretend play, although I'm sure we will use these more in the coming years as a real learning tool.  I might try these out in the tub with the rest of the plastic stuff.My mother brought these for my son, and when we took them out the first time we both were disappointed that these do not actually snap together as the title would indicate. Instead they have to be carefully lined up and only loosely hook onto one another.  This makes for a frustrating experience as my son tries to link one after the other and they all come undone, fall over, and drag the others down.  To actually get these all attached in a line takes an incredible amount of patience and a very steady hand, and while my two year old has quite good fine motor skills, this toy tends to get him upset when we attempt to get them all lined up. It is too bad because they seem well weighted and balanced and stay standing nicely when on their own or just two or three in a line.This toy would be greatly improved if they actually stayed connected in a secure way.  Then they could be played with by moving them around like a snake or train....or marching elephants!  That would be so much more fun and effective!  I think my mother imagined that these would snap together like classic pop beads or something like that.  I think that the name and description of this product is misleading.

B004EFZ8B8,"[CLS] I bought this doll on special to donate to the Toys for Tots toy drive. Wish I had gone to Target, and bought an Our Generation girl instead.  This doll has a very odd fixed stare -- like she had a cameo in a zombie movie -- and her clothing is very cheaply made (although I have not taken her out of the box, I can clearly see mis-sewn, ragged seams and hems. Madame Alexander quality this is not.) The hair is also shorter than the doll pictured, and I expect the comments about the poor quality of the hair are also true.I wasn't expecting this to be an American Girl doll, but I did expect it to be a quality item.  Don't get me wrong -- I'm sure a four or five year old will be thrilled with her -- but for this money (and with the Madame Alexander name) I expected much more.  The Our Generations girls have sweeter faces and better made clothes -- and are significantly cheaper, to boot. Journey Dolls at Toys R Us are another option -- sweet-looking and a bit cheaper. Hope this doll ends up in the hands of a three year old who will love her through mud and puddles and not care how she looks (although a mud pack would clearly be an improvement!) [SEP]"",""[CLS] There's something wrong with her head. It's incredibly loose and just constantly flops around. I read reviews saying the hair was really choppy in the back and that's true. I'm not really too concerned with that because I actually bought this for my 2 year old because she likes the dolls that look more like friends than she does the baby dolls. I knew the hair wouldn't stay pretty anyway but I would like for the head to function properly. The clothing that came with her is adorable and good quality and the doll has a beautiful face. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This doll is very pretty, and of course she can wear all the same clothes as an American Girl doll. The problem other reviewers have noted with the hair seems to have been addressed, as mine came with a very nice long, blond style.

The head is very loose, too.Comparing the price on this to other 18 inch dolls, and the relatively high quality, I have to say this is a good deal, and will definitely make a little girl happy. The face is the best feature, it is very pretty. [SEP]"",""[CLS] These 18 inch dolls are well-made, well-styled, and pretty cute. My daughter loved this when she received it. Every holiday season we are tasked with the same issue. Buy a few really nice dolls, or just one American Girl doll for the same amount of money. (you know, since the AG dolls are just $100 before accessories.)If you have a girl who is old enough to know what an AG doll is and therefore wants an AG doll, I don't think the Madame Alexander dolls are really going to effectively replace and meet the desire for an AG doll. Why? Because like all status/prestige items, the perceived value comes from the perceived desirability of the product. A girl wants an AG doll because it is an AG doll, the same way adults want designer products (shoes, purses, cell phones, cars) even though substitutes may be just as effective at half the price.For a girl who who is simply happy to receive a great doll, you can't go wrong with a Madame Alexander.

This doll has long rooted blonde hair, big plastic eyes, soft skin, dreamy child like features, and comes fully outfitted with contemporary clothes. The body is made from a durable plastic. From what I can see, this doll compares favorably with the AG doll at less than half the price. Granted, this is not an AG doll, but it would offer plenty of fun playtime for the average little girl of age 4 and above. My granddaughter's AG doll clothes are interchangeable with most 18 doll clothes including the outfits I've made myself. About the only thing I didn't love about this doll was the blonde blonde hair.My grandkid has 5 AG dolls that I bought her. She loves them but she'll love this doll too. She hasn't always been easy on them. This doll offers plenty of fun time without the inflated price tag. This is a great alternative to the pricey AG doll that suffers from over exposure and its a doll that can easily stand on its own quality.

We got it for her before she was a little over one and still loves playing with it now and she is almost 3. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this because my son played with it somewhere and fell in love. There are a few things in particular that made it stand out from many other kitchen sets. 1) the awesome Little Tikes family kitchen doesn't seem to be made anymore 2) this takes up minimal space and fits well in our small home - unlike many toy kitchens 3) it's not hot pink - fun for boys and girls 4) it has a clever electronic burner that sizzles when you place the frying pan on it and bubbles when you place the coffee pot on it; plus the microwave buttons beep (other models don't have electronic microwave panels). For a battery-operated toy that makes noise, the noise is minimally annoying but the kids love it because it seems real. Lots of fun!

B004FEMYW4,"[CLS] I got this version of Sideswipe for my son, who is a huge Sideswipe fan, for Christmas and I must say that I am disappointed with the quality of this one.First, and worst, is that the car mode does not hold together well. The arms continually pop out of their slots on the door, and the rear comes apart too easily as well.Second, the color is drab gray. No effort went into spicing this character up at all.Firtunately, I took this out of the package early (as a stocking stuffer, it would not fit packaged, plus I like to experiment with them as well to test the complexity of the transformation against my children's ability) and I therefore have time to order Sidearm Sideswipe as a replacement.This ine I'll keep myself (as a collector I have more than a few of my own) as his robot mode is very nicely done, despite the drab paint job. Not only does he have a nice mold (in robot mode), he stands much easier than the original ROTF mold. (Robot mode is what saves this one.)The mechtech weapon is the best one I've seen so far as well. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My son has several transformer toys that I have ordered from him off of amazon.com, including the incredible&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Transformers-Dark-of-the-Moon-Ultimate-Optimus-Prime/dp/B004SGLDM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Transformers: Dark of the Moon - Ultimate Optimus Prime</a>&nbsp;- a figure you can read my review of on its product page. Of all the transformer toys my son has, Sideswipe is the one he is the least content with. In fact, he regrets purchasing this toy. The main reason for this is that he cannot get the car mode to stay tight when he transforms it from robot to car (and neither can I). The side panels of the car just don't fit together snugly and stay put. They are always popping loose. This takes a great deal of the fun out of this toy, as he can't drive this car around the floor without it popping loose and not looking like a regular car, anymore. Additionally, this toy is practically devoid of paint. I've seen some other Sideswipe toys that have nice silver paint jobs on them that look classier than this one. This car is just colored, molded plastic that does not look all that great. I would not recommend purchasing this toy for your kids. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Sideswipe returns as sleek and battle ready as ever! I will start off by saying don't judge this transformer on appearence alone. I can see where some people might think that this version looks cheap,but you would be missing out on a very good transformer. I have every version of Sideswipe done and this is still an excellent transformer. This version is alot more versatile for all ages compared to others with the transformation being easier in my opinion. Sideswipe still has the stingray corvette vehicle mode,but in a convertible form with a three piece wrap around windshield. While in vehicle mode the Mech Tech weapon can attach to the door for blade attacking decepticons up close while still in vehicle mode or the weapon can attach in front of the spoiler towards the back. The Mech Tech weapon Sideswipe comes with is a Blaster that converts to a Cybertanium Sword. This is one of the better looking weapons in the Mech Tech line. In robot form Sideswipe is very detailed from the head piece and throughout the body while having his trusted deploying blades on each arm. The detail overall is very good in both modes. The poseability is very good as well with Sideswipe able to assume many poses for battle scenes or displaying him somewhere. The durability is very good also with Sideswipe able to handle many situations. Everything actually fits together very well during the transformation process. The transformation level is intermediate meaning if you have plenty of experience with transformers there is minor difficulty. If you are a parent buying for a child of 5-6 or younger you might have to help some in the process. Honestly after a few times all ages should be able to handle it. The process starts with the hood lifting up while the front wheel sections rotate out to eventually form the arms. The doors then lift up while the triangle looking piece underneath in the middle lifts up as well. The rest of the front then folds down to reveal Sideswipe's head and form the torso. The back then seperates to form the legs while the part with the spoiler then lifts upwards to be on the back of Sideswipe. Bottom line Sideswipe is an overall solid transformer that all fans can enjoy. Transformers Rule!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I would not buy this toy for a child or as a collector.  It is the loosest and hardest to transform toy I've bought for my five year old son.  The hood piece does not stay on because it was manufactured wrong and the car mode is impossible to get tight.  The only redeeming quality of the toy is the weapon, which swings out like a knife when you fire it.  My son loves the weapon and uses it with his other transformers.  Save your money and buy a better toy.

Harryhausen was the first to portray her as having a snakes body & this is how Safari has chosen to portray her and they have done a awesome job!! The  detail that Safari has put into there Mythical Realms figures are second to none!!  Medusa stands 4.5 inches tall counting the highest point of her snake filled head a beautiful detailed  bronze currase covers her waist where the snake fuses with human her waist flares looking much like a cobra's hood! The scales of her body are so detailed you can even see a center ridge on each inavidual scale. My wife has a snake phobia and she can not stomache looking at this figurine if that gives you any idea of the great detail that the sculpters & painters have put into this figure!

B004I8V6ZS,"[CLS] There is nothing more frustrating than a toy with a million pieces and complicated directions, this is definately not one of those toys. The easy to assemble track and cars are just right for young kids and older children can join in the fun as well.Straight out of the box we, as a family, put the track together within minutes. The cars are fun because they are easy to wind and start and can even be mixed and matched for added fun and flare. When the cars go down the track the added pieces can cause the cars to get stuck but it is not something that happens every time, you can adjust the pieces accordingly and the cars will run smoothly.The only real complaint I would have about this product is that the black pieces of track are not super sturdy, in my opinion they should be stronger so little kids can't accidentally snap or split them. We haven't had a break yet but I am afraid it might happen soon.Overall I really do like this set and I could see us getting a lot more for our boys. [SEP]"",""[CLS] my son got these for xmas. i LOVE that they are kid powered. you just wind them up and they go. the tracks are long but very uneven. sometimes the cars get stuck. he ejoys the fact that the winner makes the finish line flag pop up. good set OH and the cars are all interchangeable [SEP]"",""[CLS] There isn't much to this, but it is a simple like drag strip with two cars which can be switched up.  Enough for two kids to play and race.  There are definitly better cars and strips out there, but this is also far more durable than a lot of those cheap race tracks, too.  This holds up a lot better for younger kids as well, like in the 3 and up crowd.  The ability to switch the cars up adds to a lot of the fun, and being a drag strip, that adds to it, too.  You can really race each other with this.  But its a very simple concept overall.  However, younger kids have fun with this, and thats what matters.  Again, there are better out there, but this holds up and will entertain for up to an hour. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Perhaps the best quality of this toy is the ability for a child to intuitively know how to get it to go.My child learned how to wind it almost immediately, and was off for a lot of fun.The track is a nice feature, but, my son usually uses it without the track.  Its because he is 3.5 years old and he likes to keep it simple and run all over the house with it.With a friend, the track provides a good way for the two cars to race.  I think the track would appeal more to a slightly older child who would want to tinker more with the flags.This toy is very fun and most children will like it I think. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My boys love these ratchet cars!  I love that they do not require batteries and the price is affordable!You simply turn one end of the car to wind it up and then put it down and watch it go!The track is pretty darn flimsy.  I thought hot wheels tracks were bad, but this is worse.  But you don't need to use the track to use the cars.  My kids love racing them across the kitchen floor (they won't go on carpet)Great fun for the price, but the track is pretty useless. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This review is an update from the previous version, since we've had the race set for several months now. I had to give it another star, since 1) it's held up very well, and 2) it's still fun!The biggest grief in the original review was the fact that it was a flimsy track.  Well, that's actually a blessing in disguise.  The track is not made of hard plastic, but that allows it to take a beating (stepped on/thrown/twisted/chewed) and still work.  After several months, all the track pieces still fit together.  The only things that are somewhat warped are the hard plastic in the finish line flags.My sons and daughters all love this race set--it keeps them entertained and they know how to wind the cars themselves.  What they've figured out is that the cars are even more fun off-track through the kitchen.  These cars work wonderfully on any hard surface because they have rubberized tires.No batteries needed, and after months of use, the ratcheting system in both cars still work. The only gripe I have now is that you can't really find these in stores, so unless you come back to Amazon, you can't get new cars or additional track.  Oh well, no big deal there.I recommend this toy to anyone with kids who like to race cars.(Original Review)This toy has been a big hit with my boys (under 5). My oldest has finally figured out how to attach the car pieces together and twist them to wind it up before it can race. My youngest always needs help with it, which is to be expected.The toy is aimed at ages 3+. The great part about them is that no batteries are required!After long-term use, I expect that the tracks will crack easily. They aren't made of a hard, durable plastic. They remind me of clamshell plastic, like you find on berry packages at the grocery store. It seems likely that after being stepped on a few times, they would break. Of course no one wants their child to step on the toy, but realistically speaking, kids do it.Also, since the cars are mix-and-matchable, they have a plastic piece which is about an inch long and inserts into the back half of the car. This is another piece which seems a likely part to break.Overall, it has been a fun toy for my boys. They race through the kitchen and love watching the cars fly off the end of the track and keep going, bouncing off walls and corners. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This toy comes with two ratchet cars and a drag strip you put together.  The cars are really neat.  You twist the back of the car around and press the button and off they go.  My son has several of these cars and he likes the racecars that come with this set the best.  The drag strip is cute but it is very cheaply made.  The plastic is as thin as you would find in a plastic disposable plate.  I actually thought it might rip when I was removing it from the packaging because it was so flimsy.  I'm not sure how it is going to hold up with my rough and tumble two year old.  He does enjoy the drag strip though and is able to put it together by himself, and likes running the cars on it.  For the fun factor, this is a nice little set, and I would have given it five stars if not for the cheapness of the plastic.

Every player has a carton plate with snack pictures on it and and basically the object of the game is to go filling your plate with the cartons that match your snack. It becomes a little boring after a while because there aren't that many snacks on the pictures so they keep repeating themselves.

In this game, just like in SET, you're looking at a number of cards on the table, trying to find sets.  In this case, each of the cards has a number of different coloured hoops/balls, and you're trying to find a set of cards that can be combined to create a Swish, i.e. placing them on top of each other so that every ball goes through the hoop of its matching colour.HOW TO PLAYTo play, the dealer lays 16 cards in four rows of four.  Without touching or moving the cards, players now try to look for a Swish, and call out Swish! when they think they have identified one, which will earn them points. You create a Swish by placing two (or more) cards on top of each other, so that every ball swishes into a hoop of the same colour. You can rotate the cards and flip them over in order to accomplish this, but every hoop and ball must match, and there may not be any unmatched balls/hoops. After calling out Swish, you must layer the selected cards to prove that the Swish is valid. If a Swish is valid, you collect the cards, each being worth a point. This means that multi-card Swishes consisting of more cards will earn more points.  As Swishes are created, the dealer will replenish vacant spots in the 4x4 tableau with cards from the deck.CONCLUSIONS1. Simple concept: The basic idea of this game is very easy to explain and introduce to people. It's the kind of game you can have going at a social gathering, and you will quickly get a circle of curious onlookers, who will take an interest in what is happening, and start to join in.2. SET-like: The feel of the game is very SET-like, in that you are trying to find patterns, doing the mental gymnastics of imagining cards turning over in your mind, while trying to find matches. Some people will prefer to play SET, while many people who enjoy SET will enjoy the extra challenge of Swish, plus appreciate the fact that it gives some variety to the genre of pattern recognition games.3. Pattern recognition: This game is all about recognizing patterns, and visual perception. Not everyone's brain works this way - certainly mine doesn't! Some people are just particularly skilled at games like this, and it's great that they have an arena in which they can thrive and do well, when they might perform poorly in other games. The jury seems to be out on whether you can learn to become good at this game, but it does seem to me that experience does help. Even so, you won't progress beyond the point that your natural ability at spatial recognition allows, no matter how often you play!4. Brain-burning: I find games like this incredibly brain-burning and intense, and at times it feels like my brain is going to melt. Of course, that is exactly the reason why many people just love this game! Just prepared for a good brain workout!5. Actual skill: You can be genuinely good at this game, or get good at this game. As such there is genuine skill involved, especially in being able to recognize patterns quickly. Some people are naturally good at this, and others can become good at it. This does mean that there won't always be a level playing field, and sometimes you will get runaway winners. But that's because there is no real luck involved and the game does reward skill!6. Varied difficulty: I like the fact that there are variants offering different ways to play, and even to handicap good players. Given that people's ability to play this game can vary significantly, this enables you to try different approaches to the game, and even help balance the game for players of different abilities. Being able to adopt your own house rules to customize the playing experience so it works best for your group or family is very helpful.7. Multi-card swishes: Two card Swishes are fairly easy to find. In fact, because of this, it's not often worth while agonizing over the cards trying to find multi-card Swishes. Once you're familiar with the game, you may find that you want to play the Expert Swish variant, in which Swishes require a minimum of three cards!8. Family friendly: Because of the simple rules, anyone can play. This makes it very suitable as a family game, because even older children will quickly grasp what is required. In fact, don't be surprised if your children and teenagers actually do better at this game than you! Kids and adults alike can enjoy it, and match each other.9. Solitaire: Because the larger swishes can be challenging to find, this game is very suitable to be played as a solitaire activity.10. Components: The components are very unique, and the transparent plastic cards are striking and attractive. They seem to be durable and should last. If you're not careful, there is potential for them to get scratched, but they are washable and can easily be cleaned. This makes them ideal for outdoor use as well - near the pool, or even while camping.RECOMMENDATIONIf you're part of the SET-loving crowd that enjoys pattern recognition games, then you definitely need to check this out. It's been quite a hit with my family, and they just love having a game that is somewhat similar to SET, and yet offers a completely different challenge, and with much cooler cards. Even if it's not for everyone, Swish is still a very good game for what it is, and I highly recommend it. - EndersGame @ BoardGameGeek [SEP]"",""[CLS] Not very interesting and bored very quickly.  Maybe for children this would be a helpful game but it didn't click for me. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Fun game. Quick to learn quick to play. It can make your brain hurt though if you looking for a game to relax with this might not help. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The product is good. However, I wish it came with a card box to store all the slippery plastic cards. Right now, all it has it the white packaging box. Didn't see the grey/black travel bag in it at all. Really need a card box to store the cards, especially the cards are very slippery. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Good workout for mental spatial orientation.  Mix the cards, turn some over, flip others, and you have a new challenge. Fun. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I really like this card game. It challenged your visual observation abilities while playing with others.Since I played Acuity, this became a familiar toy. [SEP]"",""[CLS] With symmetry, there are basically 4 different regions in a 3x4 rectangle:1. The four corner squares.  Always Blue.2. The four long edge squares. Always Orange.3. The two center squares. Always Purple.4. The two short edge squares. Always Green.Each transparent card comes with one Ring and one Dot in two of the 12 squares.  Each card can be in 4 different configurations - as is, turn, flip, or flip and turn.  Some number of these cards is laid down (the rules suggest 16, but 12 might be better), and the players try to be the first to work out a Swish in their minds.A swish is formed when a set of stacked cards has a Ring around every Dot.  The more cards there are in a Swish, the more points it scores.I rather liked it.  It's different than the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Set/dp/B00000IV34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Set</a>&nbsp;card game, and I'd put it at about the same level.  Players will learn a little bit about symmetry in the process. The cards look gorgeous, and catch attention at gaming tables.Highly recommended. [SEP]","[CLS] Swish is a transparent card game that was nominated for Toy of the Year in 2012. It comes with 60 challenges of increasing difficulty, from beginner to expert, and is one of the best gifts you can buy for kids who like smart games and a challenge. Swish is made with high quality components, and comes with a very clear and easy to understand instruction manual - you'll be able to play within minutes of opening the box. Like all of ThinkFun's games, Swish is built to develop critical thinking skills. Playing through the increasingly difficult challenges will improve logical reasoning and visual perception skills, all through fun gameplay.

The battle-axe is better, but it won't stay in the back sheath as shown as in the photo.  It drops in all the way until the curved blade rests against his back.

No more worries about what your little one touches or puts in their mouth with these toys  as they contain no BPA, PVC, phthalates, or external coatings. Green Toys is doing every thing they can to save energy by focusing on transportation cost even when it comes down to packaging!This season, my son age 2 and daughter age 4 have been enjoying the Green Toys Pizza Parlor set.

My kids have taken turns taking orders, playing chef,  deliverer, and have had great practice learning how to serve others well!There are 27 pieces total that make up this colorfully fun set. Kids can make four individual pizza slices when playing and customize them with all sorts of toppings! Some of the toppings include red and green tomatoes, green and red peppers, cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and onions. Pretty much everything you need to make a really good slice of pie and there's even a handy pizza cutter to top it off!What's so neat about this set has to be hands down the vast variety of stackable toppings and the fact it comes with a menu sheet for taking orders ( if your little chefs in the making run out of the order sheets, there's a link to print out more on the Green Toys website).  The pieces in this set stack meaning you can put them in whatever order you so choose and easily swap them out. They don't per-say lock together. Locking pieces can be good and bad sometimes and with a pizza, I think it's great that Green Toys made them just the way they did! And an added bonus is that these pieces are compatible with all other kitchen play food sets by Green Toys.Never have a I come across a pizza set as fun, creative, or as durable! The entire set is made out of recycled plastic making it easy to clean. It's even dishwasher safe. I'm thrilled not to have to deal with chipping paint,  wood that might get old and warped after awhile, or cheap plastic. This set is recommended for children ages 24 months - 6 years. I had a play date with a few other kids to see the reactions of the children playing with the set together and it was a hit!Green Toys offers many other wonderful products as well that are all durable, educational, engaging, interactive, and lots of fun!

B004K3FCHO,"[CLS] I needed a good servo for my 1/8 e-truggy.  I've had some bad luck buying budget servos...I mean how much of a deal is a 16$ servo that doesn't last 2 weeks?  Anyway, I've found that heavier vehicles can really torture a servo, one good crash can strip the gears completely.  With this is mind I set about looking for a reliable servo for my 10lb, big tire'd, truggy.  I found this Savox 1256tg had great reviews on all of the rc foums and I found it here at Amazon for 63$ on sale.  So I pulled the trigger and had it in 4 days.  Installed it right away but I was concerned my esc's bec wouldn't be able to power it without browning out. My esc is a Hobbywing with 6v/3a switching bec.  Well it does just fine, no need for external bec luckily.  So if you get this servo and your esc has a 6v/3a bec, you should be fine, I was.  Also, this servo has no problems at all with speed or torque.  It's plenty fast enough for 99% of the rc community and it moves my truggy tires literally with ease.  I gave it a 1 (would have been half a star if I could) star reduction because it makes a buzzing noise--not a big deal, they just do.  This servo comes with all necessary mounting screws (including the one that goes into the gear to mount servo horn), a few horns, nice stickers, and a nice reusable plastic box. Overall, after reading/watching a lot of reviews and using it for a couple months now, with no issues at all, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this servo.Edit/Update 1:  --4/30/2014-- This Savox 1256 is still working like new and it has seen many, many runs on my track with nasty crashes and backyard bashing with 0 issues.  Best servo I've had!Edit/Update 2: --4/15/2015-- Servo continues to work great and it's been 1 1/2 years.  I took it apart recently, the inside looked brand new. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Great servo.

B004KAASWG,"[CLS] I received this model scale Ferrari in red - it's really nice looking, and handles well using the controls.  Both the car and control take two AA batteries each, and after using it a good part of the day the batteries are still going strong.

The floors are tile throughout, so it was the perfect road for this car and he had a blast!  For the first day he bumped into a lot and usually found his way out of corners by going in reverse.  It wasn't until the second day of play that I saw him avoiding traps by predicting where the car was headed and correcting it.  Then on the third day he had that car practically drifting!  Overall it has been fun and it has held up very well to his not so careful actions.  If I had any complaint it would be that you need a teeny tiny screwdriver to even get the darn thing out of the box. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My son likes this car.  It is true to the original car.

B004KCGC9C,"[CLS] I was very inspired by another reviewer on here, a teacher, who had purchased this set for the extra pigs for her classroom. I followed all her ideas, making copies of scoresheets and hundreds charts for the slower math learners, and gifted the extra pigs, pig position sheet and scoresheets to my 1st grader's classroom for the done early bucket.  We love PTP at home around the dinner table, and we accidentally found out it is a FABULOUS way to get kids doing math in their heads. To hear your 7 year old adding 20 +1 +1 + 15 = 37 then next roll he knows +10 then =15+ 5 puts him at 67, that is successful mental math!  He just thinks he is loving Pass The Pigs, but I see what it is doing.  My husband who never plays games LOVES this game and asks to play it during dinner with the kids. We just use the regular game, but look forward to getting the Party Edition rules going soon. [SEP]"",""[CLS] such a cute game that is great for all ages.  we often play it for family game night.  the carrying case is a nice bonus. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We love this game!!!  I do wish that this came with the original rules though.  Had to go online and print them out.  We do like having the 2 game styles to play though.  Lots of laughs. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Cute and fun game, more interesting than a dice game. What a cute idea to use little piggies. Heard about the game on the Jimmy Kimmel show.

But the pigs get worn out from use. Their little feet and tails are the first to show signs of wear, therefore they fall over instead of landing in their trotter or razorback positions. So I usually have bought entire new games to get new pigs. NOW!!!! I can buy a whole set of extras. And they come in AWESOME new colors!!! I am using the black ones right now. Midnight pigs. ha ha!! The case is nice, but I usually just stick them in a little baggie or an old&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Altoids-Small/dp/B001QWEL1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Altoids Small</a>tin, which holds them safely and fits MUCH easier into my school bag or purse. My own kids (and husband too!!) like to play this sometimes in restaurants and other places were we are just sitting and waiting.We usually just modify the game and roll only once per person, we don't need follow the written rules all the time!  For school, again, one roll per person. And if they are not good at math (as some younger kids aren't) I use a scoresheet where they just color in as many squares as their roll is worth. So if they roll a trotter, they color in 5 squares. I have even used this with special needs kids and it is much less frustrating than adding. I will TRY to attach a picture of my score sheet with customer images above, but right now it isn't letting me. I will edit when I get it up there. It is basically a paper with a 10 x 10 grid of squares I made on the computer. I put four grids on one sheet, which is 4 complete games. The first person who gets to 100 wins. Of course, older kids or those who NEED math practice get extra calculation practice by adding. sometimes I even make every 5th roll a multiple (like this roll for everyone is worth 3x what is usually is!!!) Simple! For school, I make my small group of students answer a question before they get their roll. It makes the sometimes boring drill and practice of things MUCH more fun and fast-paced. There isn't ONE student who ever didn't want to roll the pigs!! They even request this game in lieu of history bingo or something. It really is one of my favorite games. The most highly requested games are (I also made special scoresheets for those games..you can find my reviews there explaining it):1.&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Pass-the-Pigs/dp/B00005JG3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Pass the Pigs</a>2.&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Zombie-Dice/dp/B003IKMR0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Zombie Dice</a>3.&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Yahtzee-Super-Mario/dp/B003BMGU2G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Yahtzee Super Mario</a>I really love that there are more pigs in this set.

My husband bought the regular edition (which comes with 1 set of pink pigs) at the local toy store for Christmas and we have been hooked every since.  It is akin to a dice game as you roll the pigs for various combinations (with various scoring possibilities).  It is educational as well as different combos/positions yield different points and you need to add the two scores up each time.  I decided to get the Party Edition as our one set of pigs were getting dirty and it's more fun to be able to have your own set of pigs.  It is a wonderful game for the entire family!

B004KJ7TGA,"[CLS] My daughter got this as a gift for her Baby Stella doll. The quality is garbage. Save your money here. The diapers are ridiculous. They are poorly sewn, if you can call the meandering edge stitching sewing. The tiny little piece of Velcro is very difficult for a small child to line up, and the material is so stretchy that within a week the diaper will be hanging off the doll. And that is if the Velcro is still even working by then. The diaper bag itself is just weird, and there is no way a little girl can pull that Velcro apart herself if she wants to lay it flat. Or put it back together. And the handle is too short so it's awkward for her to carry it. The various stuffed accessories aren't realistic enough to be interesting. This one is a total fail and I wouldn't recommend it at all. We have had it almost a year, and I am not a reviewer who bought it as a gift and just thinks someone loves it. I'm writing this based on my actual experience with it. It stinks. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is so cute! I purchased this for my 21 month when I had my second daughter.  She loves to practice on her baby Stella and change her diapers.  I love that the diaper bag handle splits in two so I don't have to worry about her wrapping it around her neck.  I would have given this 5 stars but there is a small magnet in the top of the bottle and I took it away in fear that my little one would chew the magnet out and choke. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The diapers were useless. My 2 year old literally used them as tissues and blew her nose in them. The diaper cream tube is fun and the bottle is a step below in usefulness.

I think my 2 year olds are a little too young for it, but they like to play with the cream and the magnetic bottle is a favorite.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] My daughter, Ella, just loves this little pirate adventurer, and I have to agree!  He is one of the cutest boy loopsy's there is to be had!  From his eye patch to his skull shirt, and of course his winky pet parrot, he is just one cool Pirate!  I even warned her to keep him away from Grandpa, a pirate and skull fan all around, he's just that cute.  He'd be the doll to get little boys who are interested in their big sister's dolls, definitly not just for girls!  I had bought my Ellaloopsy her two loopsy's for Christmas and saw him on sale and just COULD NOT resist him will all his Piratey cuteness, he is just THAT adorable!  We even saved the little cardboard pirate treasure chest he came with.  Ella especially loves his poster the most, especially the little skeleton in the lower right corner.  He is Arrright!  Out of sight!  What a fright!  She likes to wear his eyepatch (a little small on her head), but she digs it, and go seek buried treasure with him.  Of the 3 loopsies she got for xmas, Patch brings out her imagination the most, thats for sure.  And those eyes, what can I say, I just adore their little button Coraline like eyes so much, so cute.  So bright and colorful are these dolls, I love them as much as my daughter and love buying them for her!  They are durable, heavy-duty without being heavy and weighing her down.  They hold up for her playing, take abuse and falls, easy to clean, clothes come off for wash (and shoes!  as Ella freaked when she saw they had no toes, then checked to make sure HERS were still attached, LOL) head twists fully around, body limps full like a rag-doll, cuddly even though its plastic, I'm not sure how they pulled that off but they did!  An amazing toy that we love!  But again, especially, the bright, colorfulness of these dolls.  They will be a hit for years to come at our house.

So our patch has been patchless since about 2 hours after he was opened. I also LOVE that Patch has permanent whitie tighties on under his clothes. Helpful for a 2 year old to have toys that have on big boy underwear for potty training purposes. I know this toy is supposed to be for older kids, but it really is a great doll, even for a 2 year old.

B004KU834G,"[CLS] My 5 year old is obsessed with all things trains.  We're in the middle of potty training (he has autism) and I wanted to have some potty presents prepared for him to help motivate him to tell us when he needs to go.  This was one of the first ones he opened and he was absolutely delighted!  It works quite well on all brands of wooden track we have on our train table and only derails occasionally around tight turns.  I like that it's thin enough (unlike some of the other battery operated Brio trains) to fit through some of the bridge track we have without getting stuck.  I also love that unlike most other trains it comes with a little conductor you can put in and take out and play with.  It also goes both backward and forward with the push of a button.  It's not very fast and doesn't make any sounds or have lights but it's cute and fun and my son has loved playing with it.  I can definitely recommend this as one of the better Brio trains for your buck!  I did NOT receive this for free or at a discount!  Hope this helps! [SEP]"",""[CLS] The Brio Travel Train is one of our grandsons favorite accessories on his train table.  Most of the pieces he has are wooden and manual, so just having something battery operated gives him great delight.  A conductor thrown in makes one happy boy.This set measures about 8 longeach train car is about 4 long.  It runs smoothly on our tracks, and the little man fits nicely into all three compartments.  The only difficulty we have is sometimes stopping it.  The train runs in both directions and requires a push down on one directional arrow or the other.  Stopping it is the opposite--making sure neither arrow is depressed, and thats  not so easy for a three year old.  We solved the problem by showing him that all he needs to do is put two fingers over each directional arrow at the same time.  That action ensures neither arrow depresses.  It requires picking up the trains, but that is part of three year old fun, and he doesnt mind at all.  He enjoys playing with this train on tracks and everywhere else in the house [SEP]"",""[CLS] My son's really into trains.This fits on standard wooden tracks, and, when on, can round pretty sharp corners.Pros: I like how detailed it is, and that the doors flip up, and that you put the passengers in.

B004L2LB10,"[CLS] Here's Jack, one of the 5 members of a gang of construction machines called The Pack (out of a dozen) in the Take-n-Play line as of Spring 2013.  He's an enthusiastic and friendly front loader, red & cream with the #11 on both sides, and the TnP model has hinges at both the base of his arms to allow them to move up and down, as well as where his scoop is attached to his arms so that he can scoop up or dump his loads... our grandson loved using M&Ms when he played with these guys!  He also has a protruding magnet on his rear to connect up to any rolling stock pieces your youngster might have. (By the way, despite this listing having the same model # (V1297) as the one we purchased for $6.64 in 2011 for our grandson's collection, the photo shown is far different from ours... the scoop on ours is hollowed out, allowing for actual SCOOPING, and there are other differences as well.)  Our grandson would typically have his Pack members working at his Slate Loading Station playset, with the other available members being:  Byron (#18, a bulldozer), Isobella (#22, a vintage flatbed lorry), Kelly (#17, a crane truck) & Alfie (#12, an excavator).  As of March 2015, Fisher-Price has Jack listed with a $6 MSRP.Additional Pack members are: Nelson (#10, a ballast tractor), Oliver (#14, another excavator who's larger than Alfie), Max & Monty (#15/#16, dump truck twins), Ned (#19, a steam shovel), Patrick (#23, a cement mixer), and Buster (a steamroller, and the only Pack member who doesn't sport a number.)  We heard Oliver, Max & Monty will be joining the TnP line as releases stemming from 2015's Sodor's Legend of the Lost Treasure DVD, which makes us both happy and sad.  Why?Well, Fisher-Price took over the diecast Thomas line from Learning Curve's Take-Along in 2010, renaming it Take-n-Play.  Throughout 2010, 2011 and 2012, ALL of the trains and vehicles were just terrific... heavy diecast little models with an incredible amount of detailing.  In 2013, we started noticing some shortcuts being taken, worsening as the year went on, and we stopped collecting at the end of 2013.  What has happened to the line in 2014/2015 has been nothing short of horrific... not only are the new introductions completely plasticized (with the only metal about them being their magnetic connectors), stripped of the traditionally excellent detail work and contained in much flimsier packaging, but they've also started REPLACING the older, high quality models that had been in the line with cheap imitations.  And this is WHILE Fisher-Price is maintaining or sometimes even raising MSRPs.  That's not the best way to maintain a loyal following.  (And just so you're aware, Take-n-Play products are not compatible with wooden tracks.)We'd be so happy to see Oliver, Max & Monty added if they were as quality made as the previous Pack members, but they just won't be, and that's what makes us sad.10/25/16 update:  I'm going back and adding this update to each of my Take-n-Play reviews, since it's important information for any parents/grandparents out there with a young Thomas & Friends enthusiast who holds a special place in their heart, and is considering beginning a collection for them.  I just found out the TnP line of diecast trains/vehicles/rolling stock with magnetic connectors is being REPLACED by Fisher-Price in 2017 with a diecast line called Thomas & Friends Adventures, which will be TnP models modified with PLASTIC HOOK & LOOP COUPLERS.  Obviously, your youngster will not be able to connect the 2014-2016 TnP models (with their flat, round 1-way magnetic connectors), nor the 2010-2014 TnP models - or Learning Curve's compatible 2002-2010 Take Along models - with their protruding 2-way magnetic connectors - with the new types of couplers as of next year.2/17/17 Update:  Fisher-Price must've received a slew of complaints from Take-n-Play owners, because they've now developed magnetic clip engine connectors (to clip onto the magnetic trains - but ONLY those with the flat round 1-way magnets... they don't want to invite comparisons between the high quality of the older trains with protruding 2-way magnets! - that have a plastic hook & loop coupler to be able to connect to the new Adventures engines), along with track adapter pieces (Take-n-Play track pieces/sets have only 1 male or female part at the end to connect up to other track/sets, while the new Adventures tracks/sets have both one male & 1 female part on EACH end), available by directly contacting F-P.

B004LKRRBU,"[CLS] The 2011 Holiday Barbie has all the Hallmarks of the series: a lovely Barbie in special collector packaging and fantastic gown.This year's Barbie comes in a rare slim gold underskirt (rather than the usual large hemmed ball gown) with flowing green silk-like overskirt.  The overskirt is decorated with gold embroidery and jewel details.  Her hazel eyes with their sparkly gold eyeshadow make a nice match with the golden chandelier earrings. She wears matching gold open toed shoes under the skirt.  This is definitely one of the most sophisticated looking of all the Holiday Barbies.As with all of the recent Collector Holiday Barbies, she really isn't intended to be deboxed or played with. The doll doesn't come with a stand and her hair is heavily gelled to keep the curls in place (not really suitable for brushing or you destroy the style).  As well, the back of the dress lacks the details of the front and doesn't have any of the volume when removed (recebt year Holiday Barbies (like this one) have cardboard inserts under the dresses to keep them 'fluffed out' and full in the hemline).  Her dress is sewn into the box to keep a perfect display - it isn't quite as lovely when removed and without the restraints to keep it in place.  She also has the model muse body - which means she isn't pivotal and can't hold any other pose.  There were two very slight, barely visible pulls in the gold part of the dress on my doll.  Her hair is a mess in the back.Since the box is heavily decorated with the arriving at the Christmas Ball theme to match the dress, I'd recommend this for those who enjoy the entire display without wanting to debox.  If you are giving this as a present for a younger child to display out of the box, you'll need to get a Barbie-sized doll stand separately.In all, a lovely addition to the series (though I do wish they would include display stands for those of us who like to remove our Barbies from the box).

Barbie is glamorized further with her make- up and accessories, which include earrings, gold slippers, and other items. She is a sight to behold, and that is why many will likely place this Barbie on display and not do anything else with it. She even comes in her own display box for this very purpose.My girls like the Barbie Collector Holiday Doll, but they don't play with her the way they do other Barbie's and I am pretty sure this is due to the collector nature of this doll. With the flowing gown and accessories, she is more of a display item and even though my girls are too young to consider themselves Barbie collectors (or to even know what that means), they tend to place this Barbie off by herself, on a bedroom shelf, while they play with their more casual Barbie dolls. They still like her- just in a different way. The manufacturer released this as a collector's item, so I suppose this reaction should be expected.Barbie Collector Holiday Doll is a glamorous doll and she follows in the footsteps of other Barbie collector holiday dolls released over the past few years. She may not induce the level of play like other Barbie dolls, but she is a nice collector's doll and most girly- girls will love her regardless. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I really don't like that Amazon is adding toy features for me to critique with this product.  This is NOT a toy doll by any means of the imagination.  At least it isn't a toy doll in my home.  It is a collectible.  It is a GORGEOUS collectible.I originally bought this for my 2-year old.  Yes..it's meant for 6 and up.  However, I've been wanting a Barbie doll for her and I thought What a great (free) way to get her one!  WRONG!  There is no way I'll let her touch this doll.  The dress is finely detailed and Barbie's earrings, well, they're nicer than what I have.  Her hair is immaculate.  It makes me wonder if I want to begin collecting them for my daughter.  Rather smart of Mattel if you ask me.Unless you don't mind spending a LOT of money on a doll and letting your child (possibly) destroy it, don't think of this as a hands on toy.  Think of it as what it's called, a collector doll.  It's well worth the money. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a stunning barbie doll that you will feel bad to take out of the box.

She has a collection of her movies and has around fifteen dolls that she constantly playing with.  She even bring some of them in the tub.  She always wants to dress them up and brush their hair.With this barbie, it will be a shame to treat her the same.  She is a doll that deserve to be on display cabinets.  The box itself is a work of art.  She is properly secured in the box, not even a piece of her hair or her earrings can be displaced in the box the way they packaged her.Her dress is green with accents of floral decorations and gems.  She has dangling earrings.  Her lipsticks is cherry red as well as her nails. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The review form asks me to rate this as a toy, but I cannot.

The crushed velvet green dress is unusual and with intricate designs that contrast perfectly with the smooth silky sheen of the gold under-fabric.

B004LKUYVK,"[CLS] This is another peg board toy but is more unique. It's brightly colored and cute. The foam pieces are also very thick and will last. I definitely recommend this for any toddler. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Really cute, vibrant colors and I great idea - but it's just really hard to squeeze the pegs into the little foamie pieces.  Maybe they will loosen up -- we just got this toy -- but still...might be a little frustrating for little hands.  Absolutely adorable though (although the pegs are only two kinda ugly colors). [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 2yr old loves to play with blocks and other stacking toys.  However, she finds that this toy is hard to put together.  The holes on the foam pieces are small compare to the plastic pegs that fit on them.  We have to push really hard for the pegs to fit into the foam.  I can see that if we play with it more, the holes will get bigger and become easier for her to do by herself.  She loves the color jungle animals that are on the mat; especially the monkeys.  So far, I find that this toy captures her interest long enough for me to do some simple house chores likes doing the dishes but due to its difficulty to fit, she does give up after a while and move onto a different toy.  There are many foam pieces that come in this set and I would like to point out that the pieces are hardly duplicates of each other.  For example, there are 2 birds foam pieces but they are different; there are 2 monkeys and they are different also.  The quality of the foam pieces are good also; they do not smell toxic nor feels slippery like other cheaply made foam toys.  The peg pieces are also high quality; made of thicker/heavier plastic and fit well into each other.  Overall, I would buy this toy again but may be for kids that are a little bit older and strong enough to push the pieces into each other by themselves.

We lost one of the pegs after a couple of months (there are 5 pegs of each color) and every time after that he tries to sort them, he gets upset that the purple is incomplete. The funny thing is that all kids who come over for play dates get upset about the same thing. This might be good for 1.5-2 yo kids who  just learn colors or counting to 5. Or maybe for toddlers who can sit still and play with the same thing for a while. But I would not recommend for any active kids who like to reenact various scenarios or are old enough to start looking for patterns on their own - too boring for them.

Of course, we purposefully included some words that would allow the littles to successfully participate, but it was still fun and competitive.  Even for those who aren't musically inclined, the spoken words and occasional duet made everyone laugh.The game was so popular with our group, I received a call a couple of weeks later with a request for the name of the game.  I sent a picture of the cover, and they purchased it for their friends-gathering, too.  Obviously, this game was a hit! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Given as a gift. She said she liked it.

I even reasoned with myself to pay full price for it (which I almost never pay full price for anything) and I am pleased to exclaim how satisfied I am. No regrets. This is hands down one of the most fun games I have ever played. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My family and our guests enjoy this game very much, even the reluctant players ended up belting out their favorite songs.  None of us can sing - ok, well maybe 2 out of the 8 that played had nice voices, the rest of us didn't care.  It took a little bit for us to really get into the game.  Each person gets their own paper for trigger words and then you start rolling the dice.  What I liked best about this game is the cards you can draw.  They're very fun and creative.  My 16 year old nephew had to make a rap (he loves rock so this was a challenge), and I had to sing the national anthem...by myself.  It was hilarious.  Since we had players that were 12 to 65, we had quite the range of music and songs.  Often the generations didn't know each other's music, but that's okay.This is definitely a game where the more fun you make it, the more fun it will be.  Meaning, if you just sit there and don't sing, it will probably suck.  If you're up for some mind bending challenges and a good time, bring your energy and let loose.  It's actually quite hard to think of songs on the spot while everyone else is chiming in with their own tunes.  I found my entire iPod would disappear from my mind and I wasn't very good at the personal challenges.  No worries, I still had a blast and look forward to playing again.Very creative game that will change each time you play it depending on the players.

B004LYP0HY,"[CLS] This game is a pretty crazy one. The rules of the game are constantly changing, based on whatever cards are played, each round. (The game even comes with some blank cards, so players can make up a few of their own rules.) Most of these rules involve requiring players to preform some action or speak some silly phrase when their turn comes around. Players who fail to follow all the current, in-play, rules are eliminated.As I already mentioned, the rules are constantly changing, and it seems like an ADD kid's worst nightmare. However, it's been my experience that kids enjoy this game more than adults. Generally speaking, as your level of maturity goes up, your willingness to be silly declines. Since this game is based on silliness, the teen crowd is going to enjoy this game the most, and they will find it most fun when playing with larger groups.The game is definitely OK, and it's a creative way to get people to be silly, but I don't think I am part of the target consumer group for this game. If I were a teenager reviewing this game, my score for it would definitely be higher. [SEP]"",""[CLS] `Gotcha!' was a surprise hit in my house last weekend.  After reluctantly finishing a game of `Quelf' the week before, I wasn't sure I could handle another colossal failure in the form of a game that indulges itself in making people act stupid for no apparent reason whatsoever.  Thankfully, within moments of gameplay, `Gotcha!' proved itself far more than I initially gave it credit for.  Yes, this is a game that relishes in stupidity (`play air guitar before picking up a card', `smell yourself before picking up a card', `give the player to your right the thumbs up for the entirety of their turn') but it is so quick witted that the stupidity translates into actual humor.This game is a laugh riot, not necessarily because of the `things you have to do' but more so because of the reaction this garners from your friends and family.The basic gist of the game is that you have to divvy out rules to the other players by laying down cards that indicate restrictions (they can't laugh...etc.) or requirements for the remainder of their gameplay.  Things get sticky as the rules continually pile up (and overlap one another) and so forgetful players may find themselves getting buzzed by the more observant players as they fail to live up to their end of the bargain so-to-speak.  There will be lots of yelling and buzzing and laughing and adjustments to rules that only add more excitement to the game itself.And yes, K. Harris is right; if you are drinking then your enjoyment will be enhanced considerably. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We received two games at the same time and gave them both a try on the same night, so we may have over-gamed ourselves! But let me start by saying that this game was definitely fun. I think the tricky part is that we were playing with some people who, well, aren't that great at playing games? One of them tends to have what I call Poker Bi-Polar Disorder - as in she's happy when we start and she's winning but when she starts losing she gets upset! So every time we'd catch her and say Gotcha she'd get more and more upset.Overall, however, the game was quite fun! Our 10 and 7 year olds tried it with us the next day and while the 10 year old had no problem with it, the 7 year old got frustrated as she tended to get caught pretty frequently. Imagine turning this game into a drinking game! Now that I may have to try!!

It really brought out the goofball in all of us and we were howling ~ weakened by our silliness and laughter.  This game is REALLY fun -- it's not perfect, but nobody cared!!  For those who enjoy interactive games that includes various ages, this is a fun one!! [SEP]","[CLS] In Gotcha!, players make the rules and try not to get caught breaking them! During each turn, rule cards are played that can affect any of the players. For example, a rule card may read People wearing jeans must use finger quotes while speaking or This player must play air guitar before playing a card. While trying to follow the constantly changing Rule Cards, each player also tries to catch his or her opponents breaking a rule. The first player to catch a rule being broken hits the buzzer and scores! The more rules that are played (and broken), the funnier the game gets. There are thousands of possible rules combinations, making each game different. Recommended for 3 to 8 players, ages 14+.

B004M05IK6,"[CLS] I got this in 2011.  So far it has held up to 6 summers of use by my 3 daughters, youngest are now 6 and 7.  I love it.  Before this, I had a series of inflatable pools, that always broke and caused tears and a lot of work to puff up.  This is small, but sturdy.  It doesn't leak.  It's not big enough for lots of kids to sit in together.  But my kids and their friends still enjoy it on the back deck, along with squirting the hose at eachother.  I hesitated to buy this because it costs more than the inflatable ones, but it really has held up better.  Glad I got it.We broke or maybe lost the umbrella a few years ago.  Pool still fine without it.  The umbrella was nice while it lasted, though bigger kids couldn't fit under it well. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this for the summer to use with my 16-month-old son and his 20-month-old friend. I was really impressed with the quality. The included water toys were a big hit and it was nice that there were many different ones to choose from.I really like the hard plastic bottom. There is enough space in it for two toddlers to sit inside. I found that when toddlers are playing together one always tends to stay outside using it as a sort of water table while the other one sits inside---just as in the advertised photo.I was dissatisfied when I opened the box to find that the pieces needed to hold up the umbrella were missing but I contacted Step2 and they quickly sent the pieces separately. Very good customer service for a quality product. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I wanted something that wasn't inflatable.  This fit the bill, plus it comes with an umbrella!  It fits two toddlers perfectly, but no more.  There is a little ledge to sit on.  The three cup things rotate a little too easily, so you can't really play with them as intended. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this for my 9-month old granddaughter.  It was very easy to put together and the instructions are quite good.  The little pool comes with a little water wheel that turns when the child (or in our case grandpa) pours water into the cups.I was a little worried that it would be too small because some reviewers mentioned that it was on the small side.  I anticipate that our grandbaby will enjoy the pool at least all of this summer and next.  She fits in perfectly and she can splash around and kick her legs.  I don't think it's suited for two little ones however.Once she grows out of the pool with water, I will use it as a sandbox.  The pool itself is quite light and easy to store on a hook sideways.  We warmed up the water some after filling the pool and it was ready for baby.  I thought she might be afraid at first but she took to it immediately (as you can see from the picture).  So glad I got; baby and all the adults had a great time with this very inexpensive baby pool [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a super cute pool.  Love the size, perfect for toddlers.  Allows enough water for splash play, but good placement of internal elevations to help prevent drownings.  The umbrella helps protect from dangerous sun UVA/UVBs.  The included water toys are fun for little hands.  Really appreciate the drainage hole on the side. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This little pool has a diameter of approximately 3 feet with an umbrella that shades about 2/3 of the pool.  There are two little molded benches in the plastic, one on either side of the umbrella.  Cups hang from the umbrella and kids can play with the spinning wheel and pour while seated in water.I ended up buying this pool because I wanted a molded pool and my local toys r us was not carrying molded pools this year (and I had no time to go to the next town and see what they had).  I also admit, this pool is cute and I like the fact that the umbrella comes with it and attaches. This was an early second birthday present for my daughter and she loves it.  We've had it for about 5 weeks and she really enjoys playing with the cups, playing with her toy boats (not included) and squeeze toys (also not included) and splashing in there.  The pool IS small but really, most wading pools are small.  I had the pool out during a barbecue and I easily fit 3 toddlers in there and there was room for one more.  Actually my almost 6 year old was in there too with 2 toddlers.  So yes, it's small, but not so small that it is useless.  More than one child WILL fit.  It's also sturdy.  I used to buy an inflatable pool every year, but this one looks like it will last until she outgrows the baby pool stage.I rate this pool with 4 stars not 5 because it does not contain a drain.  You have to lift and dump it which is rather inconvenient.  Otherwise, however, the pool is excellent. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My son is 3 months shy of his 4th birthday and we just got this pool for him. He's had the Step2 water table since he was 1 and has gotten many hours of play out of it. So when the weather got warm this year it was the first toy he wanted out, but unfortunately he has literally outgrown the water table (he always loved climbing up to sit in it), well he's 42 inches tall and kept ending up tipping the water table over on himself. So we figured it was time to replace it with something else, of course this is what he picks out at the store. At first we were unsure, but he loves it. He's never really liked pools and always picks playing with his water table instead, so this fits the bill. It's basically a larger version of the water table without legs it can tip over on. I would even recommend this instead of a water table, since it's larger.So if you're older kid wants an actual pool then this would not be a good buy, but if your child is like mine and prefers a water table to splash around in a bit, then this is a great product. There's enough room where he can sit in there with his legs fully stretched out. [SEP]","[CLS] This toddler pool will make any swim party fun!

Of course, it does go a bit slower the more weight that's on it. (130 pounds is the limit.) My youngest can zoom through the yard quicker when he's on it alone.The battery is rechargable, and it's super easy to get in and out of the vehicle. When the battery runs down, my children know how to remove it themselves to charge. The battery has a pretty good lifespan for each charge. (They do generally have to charge it each day after riding, but they get a good bit of riding through the day.)The assembly is easy and quick. My husband had no trouble with it.

The size works equally well  for both of them to ride comfortablely with room to spare. Some of the highlights on assembly and riding:Assembly:Assembling the car took my son a little over an hour with some assistance from another adult. The instructions themselves are clear to read and easy to follow. At one point, you need to flip the car on its side to attach the drive shaft and that is where we needed the other adult. All but one tool is included in the kit and it is easy to find the tool, screws or car piece that you need which coordinates with that step in the directions. One area of frustration while assembling was the front license plate, it is hard to line up the plate with the precut holes in the car so that took a few attempts before getting it right. We also had to find a deeper screwdriver for this part to ensure the screw was all the way in and tight. Other than that, assembly was very smooth and moved along quickly. There was one piece that came broken out of the box in the gear shift area. but that does not impact performance, just frustrating to the parent.Final Assembled Product:One huge improvement on this particular Power Wheel vehicle that is different from our other two (we have 5 grandchildren and  we have the jeep, and a motorcycle that they all use in rotation) is the battery storage. I have included a picture for your reference. This new storage access area is great and such a welcome improvement over other models. The battery tucks in nicely and door closes keeping the kids from accessing it while they are playing with it.The open seat design  allows for my older grandchildren, ages 6 and 8, to also be able to fit comfortably with some knee bend. The steering wheel is far enough out that all the children can sit under the wheel and steer comfortably.  Gear shift is easy to move, even my youngest grandson can easily control moving front and back and quickly learned how to do this. As a grandparent, I love the new lock that comes on to control the dune buggy speed. A screw needs to be taken out for the dune buggy to reach top speeds. This allows me to safely ensure that my youngest grandson can't accidentally put in high gear and move faster than he can handle. On the other hand, when the older riders are in the car, I can remove it and they can drive faster.The dune buggy steers well and takes corners nicely without the wheels spinning. We have a light dusting of snow on the ground right now so we couldn't test on grass but on the sidewalk, light snow covered ground and driveway it drove great. The wheels are a bit wider than our other models so they seemed to control the terrain better.We are very happy with this product and would recommend for other parents/grandparents looking to invest in a powerwheel. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This Power Wheels Dune Racer was the first electric vehicle our family had gotten in about two years, when we got a John Deere truck that my kids loved riding around a grassy, slightly rough acre of land around the house. They were obviously very excited to see this dune racer arrive and were eager to get it set up for use. While it is not particularly difficult to assemble, the battery takes a very long time to charge. This was the main problem we had with the John Deere vehicle, and ultimately the kids lost interest since the battery ran down fairly quickly and then took an extremely long time to recharge. I am hoping that this battery, which so far seems to have a lasting charge, fares better over time.It's a sturdy little buggy, and I did not have much safety concern. My two daughters, both petite and ages nine and five, were able to fit easily into the seats. There is no dash, so they have ample leg room and the steering wheel is not uncomfortably close to my eldest girl's chest. It zips along without being too fast, and it worked just fine on the same grassy, slightly rough/uneven ground that we used for the John Deere a couple years ago. So long as the battery lasts, I would recommend this, with the understanding that it will take the battery a long time to charge. My kids love it, and overall, I would say that it is a better vehicle overall than the John Deere truck we had before. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Overall, my main frustration with this item was from a few steps in the assembly.  Because of the concave nature of the wheels, the wrenching and screwdriving required to get the wheels on the axles was unnecessarily difficult. I also noticed that one of the wheels does not align great with the other 3 wheels, on the car I received.  This likely won't affect the performance, but may affect the longevity of the wheels and axles.  I also had one step while attaching the plastic top to the metal frame, that one of the plastic pieces sunk into the inside of a metal bar on the frame and it was incredibly hard to get out.As far as the function of the ride-on, it has worked very well thus far on our hilly and bumpy terrain.  It seats two kids (ours are 2 and 4) very comfortably.  Our 2-year-old is not tall enough to reach the pedals.  I like the feature that locks the ride-on at a lower speed (2.5 mpg) with a screw.UPDATE November 2nd, 2017: This ride-on has performed well after one season.  I wanted to add that it also handles driving through the wooded trails on our property. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Simply the best car! We reviewed a lot of them and this was the best. No problems at all. Kids love it. Nice storage area in the front too. Works perfect on grass with traction wheels. I like that it sits lower for easy in and out and has bars to help keep from falling out. Keeps my toddlers safer while driving around our property. Couldn't be happier. 10 stars!

My only wish is that the puzzle had pictures of the animals instead of just a blank colored shape.Update: after playing with it for less than 24 hours, the animal pieces had chunks of paint breaking off.

B004MW46RU,"[CLS] This is an interesting little two player game.  There are two parts to the game: first you divide up the cards and try to do it such that the other person doesn't get good stuff.  Then there's an auction phase in which you bid for the remaining cards.  You wouldn't think an auction would work for a two player game but it does.  It's light, quick and pretty fun.  If you played it a lot I suspect it would get old, but as just one game in a large collection, it's great.  Quality of the box and pieces is really outstanding. [SEP]"",""[CLS] A lot like For Sale if you've ever played that. Game has two rounds - the first involves each player choosing to put card/s in their hand, in an auction pile and in the Public pile. The trick is you can only draw one card at a time, making your decision right then and there as to where it goes. Draw something you think sucks and have thrown it in the public pile (where others take it) only to draw something even worse that you end up having to give to yourself - is how it goes sometimes (a lot).In the second round you bid on the cards that were thrown in the Auction pile and this is pretty much where the real heart of the game shows itself.The game revolves around balancing the amount of gold you have with collects cards in certain categories (that each have point values) - person with the highest point value in each of those categories gets a certain number of victory points based on a what value a dice shows (and those dice having been manipulated throughout the two rounds to either be low or high in value).Personally, I love these deceptively simple games. Not 5 stars because it IS a filler game. with a large group of more experienced players you'll probably play his waiting for that other person show up so you can start Dead of Winter or something. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Biblios: 2-4 Players, Ages 10+, Average Playtime = 30 MinutesBiblios reminded me a bit of For Sale (albeit a more complex version) in the sense that the game is broken up over two phases.  Phase one has players acquiring cards while phase two puts said cards to use to acquire other cards.  The mechanics between the two games are obviously somewhat different, but the overall idea is the same.  Players who have played bidding games like For Sale should be able to wrap their heads around Biblios without too much of a problem.  Those new to the concept may want to reserve an extra half hour of playtime, just until they get used to the flow of play.Speaking of flow of play, players who are great at counting cards and calculating statistical probabilities will have a leg up in this game.  Cards in each of the five categories have certain point values and if you're good at observing whats been played so far, you can get a feel of what your odds are in winning a particular category.  If you see low cards of a particular color being scattered around the table during the first phase, for example, you might be able to win the category with just a few high cards of that color.  Granted, some cards are removed from the game at random during setup so it would be impossible to know how much of a color is truly in the deckstill, a good memory helps.If you're not good at counting cards or have a terrible memory like myself, then you can get a feel for what colors players are going after via the church cards, which add or subtract pips on the dice in the scriptorium.  If you know cant win in a particular category, you may want to reduce that dies value so that whoever does win it, won't get as many victory points.  Theres also some strategy in the cards you chose for both yourself and others during the gift phase.  Gathering plenty of gold is great for the auction phase, though might leave you dry on category cards if the bids are generally high.Ive slammed French Game Publisher Iello in the past for releasing games that featured subpar components (Steam Park is a prime example), though in this case, its hard to mess up a deck of cards, a tracker, and dice.  Thankfully they didnt, making the game an easy recommend.  Its packed full of strategy and has a pretty quick play time to boot, making it an ideal way to get your fix for the night without having to allocate too much time out of your day.  The price is my only real complaintat $18-$20, the game could have stood to be a few bucks cheaper based on the number of components involved.  Still, great job! [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a very simple game with very few components, however it is not easy to win. There is a lot of thought behind pretty much every option you have in order to succeed. Best only with four players, cannot be played with five or more.Simply draw a card, decide if you want to keep it, pass it to others, or save it for auction later, you can only choose to keep one, auction one, and pass the rest, but you only look at one card at a time of five. So is the next card better for you than the current? This is where it gets tricky, and fun. I like this game, it sold for upwards of $100.00 when out of print, so that means everyone likes this game. Buy it unless its $100.00, then wait for the next print or I'll sell you my copy. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Biblios has to be the card game that Reiner Knizia wanted to make - it's that good. But unfortunately for him designer Steve Finn beat him to it! Originally published as Scripts & Scribes, this game was one of those cult hits that became a kind of underground phenomenon among those who could get their hands on it. Described by some as For Sale type filler on steroids, it uses familiar mechanisms in interesting ways to create a fun experience with surprising depth in the short time it takes to play. It all comes together in a very successful and deservingly popular package, and the good news is that in the past year Scripts & Scribes was elevated from its humble VHS case status, and joined the world of real games under the name Biblios. With the help of publisher Iello, Pinocchio has become a real boy at last, making this great little card game widely available with new artwork and quality components, and fortunately not changing a thing about the great gameplay.At its core it is a set collection game, but it begins with a drafting phase where players create an auction deck and give cards to their opponents. Then follows an auction phase as players compete for the cards in the auction deck, trying to establish point-scoring majorities in the five different suits. Oh and did we mention that there are ways to manipulate the points each category is worth by changing the dice totals corresponding to each set type?Biblios gets just about everything just right: mechanics, rules, length, interaction, scalability, luck, strategy, tension, fun factor and surprise factor. It's all very well balanced, and will thus appeal to a broad range of people. It also combines a variety of mechanics in a delightful and satisfying way. Admittedly the theme is pasted on, because really all that matters are the numbers and suits, so it could be set collection for anything. In that respect Biblios reminds me a great deal of the best of master designer Reiner Knizia - cards with numbers, pasted on theme, but rich and rewarding game-play that makes me come back again and again. In fact, few would have questioned it had Knizia's name been on the box, because it's that sort of game, and right up there with some of Knizia's best fillers and auction games.

B004MW55Z2,"[CLS] Just got this for my son for his 3rd birthday and he thinks it's great. He's short (35) and so I love how little this bike is. We haven't gone outside with it yet, but he figured it out really quickly in our kitchen. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We got this for my son when he was three, and he has been using it ever since (now nearly six).  Bike is very high quality, and has stood up very very well over time and constant use.Only problem with this was transitioning him to a regular bike.  He had a hard time learning how to use the pedals to start and stop, since he had spent so much time using his feet. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We just got this for our 3 yr. old for Christmas and it's perfect.  It's SO light weight yet, takes falls and bumps perfectly and the adjustable seat let us put it at just the right level for his extra long legs.  And the price can't be beat!  He loves having a bike like his big sister and hopefully, it will help him easily transition to regular bike riding.  (I'll update when he does).  This is so much more economical than buying a trike, then a bike with training wheels, the a regular bike. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Well made bike. Sturdy but will get scratched up easily. Seat height is adjustable, but not recommended for shorter height child under 2yo. Wished it had a kickstand built onto the bike.

The bike itself is really sharp looking too. I'm still not convinced this is better than a traditional bike with training wheels, but giving it a try. If you are looking for a training bike, this bike is top notch. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I chose this bike with my 3 1/2 year old in mind. She is pretty tall (size 4 pants) and does great on the balance bike! She has a scooter and some cheap-o roller skates so she's pretty coordinated. It took her a couple of days but now she is gliding down our gentle hill the whole way with her feet up. I didn't think our 6 year old would be interested in the balance bike, he usually prefers rollerblading or the scooter but he loves the bike. Now it is small, he kind of reminds me of a bear in a tutu riding a tricycle in a circus when he's on it, but he gets going super fast coming down the hill and has no problems keeping his feet out of the way. He kind of squeezes his knees together and tucks his feet by the back wheel and he is good to go! Both kids have learned to steer going around corners without falling. In fact I would say the small size is a big advantage in this balance bike. The kids can get going pretty fast on it and if they were sitting up high like a regular bike they would both have some pretty serious bruises and other injuries. They have wiped out on it big time but the short fall means minimal injury. I would totally recommend this bike for preschoolers, and if you have an older kid around they might have some fun with it too. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The Chicco red bullet balance bike was super easy to put together, only taking about 15 minutes (maybe less) and the only tool you need is supplied. It was basically sliding a few parts together and tightening two screws, very simple. My two year old is just about the perfect size and skill level for this bike, he can sit on the seat and roll easily and hardly ever falls over, however my four year old is WAY too big for this, but in my opinion this is just a really small bike, I can't imagine any three year old of average height would get much use out of this bike before they get too large for it.

B004O0TOJA,"[CLS] I was pleasantly surprised to see that these pieces were finely crafted plastic with cool 'hinges' for the corners.All the pieces are numbered and it's important to put them in number order because there are many pieces that fit in multiple places but unless you go in number order, you can be out of luck as you finish up a row. There were a few pieces that the number imprint was impossible to read so those waited until we had holes to fill in.The pieces can be pushed together on a flat surface so they are smooth on the outside. But when you bend the corners (and I tried it both ways, bend the pieces and then assemble or bend the assembled parts) the other pieces can pop out of place. Eventually, it all goes together.My 13 year old son and I worked on this together and it went up quickly. There are two plastic frames that help to put the different levels together (where the clock face sticks out and the tower top adds in).This is a pretty small puzzle when assembled, less than a foot tall. But it was fun overall even though it was frustrating at times.Ravensburger makes quality puzzles and as a leader in the industry, I'm not sure if there is a better way to do a puzzle corner. These are solid, just awkward at times. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My teenage son solved the puzzle, it took him a couple of hours to finish. The pieces snapped together very well. We liked especially the corner pieces, they bend and snap in the middle so they become very sturdy. The whole finished puzzle looks nice, the printing is quite nice. The result is sturdy, my son dropped it on the floor, and it was still OK. The base separates from the building, and the building itself separates in three parts.There is also a short note explaining the history of the building.Very nice puzzle indeed. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a very fun puzzle for older kids and adults alike. The plastic pieces fit perfectly and once assembled it is even more beautiful than in pictures. The assembly is suggested to be done in three major steps - some pieces for the base, some for the middle portion and some for the final top portion. The base and middle are easiest and the top portion does require some precision and dexterity. The entire puzzle took a leisurely two hours for an adult and a child working together. This is a very fun toy that also encourages kids to learn about the Big Ben in London. Made in Czech Republic. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Fun But Needs a Little Parent Help [SEP]"",""[CLS] One of the things we like about Ravensberger puzzles, is that the pieces are all unique shapes, and don't fit i multiple places. This, however, had not only the reoccurring pattern, but reoccurring shapes, and the only real way to get it together was to do it in numerical order (back is numbered) and to heed the arrows (they show you which way it orients).In the end it feels more like assembling an ikea dresser than a puzzle. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This and the Ravensburger Eiffel Tower are now displayed side-by-side in the boys bedroom. My sons and I enjoyed putting these together in just, maybe two hours total, all working together on both puzzles at the same time. We used the numbers printed on the back of the pieces, as we were interested in results. I don't know if you'd call that cheating, but that's the way we enjoyed these. So of the bends near the top of Big Ben's tower were a little hard to keep together during the build, but once enough pieces were joined, it made the whole strong enough to stay together well. I''m actually quite impressed with the quality and precision of the pieces. These were the first two 3D puzzles we completed. We will be buying more.

Most of the pieces for the ones I have built before had pieces made from a type of foam. While these pieces were easy to snap together, they weren't as sturdy as they should be. Also, these foam puzzle pieces had pictures glued to the front, but when you started putting the puzzle together, pieces of the illustration would either stick out or there would be too much foam showing. Reading some info about the differences between Ravensburger 3D puzzles and other 3D puzzles, when I had the opportunity to try out and build the RAVENSBURGER BIG BEN 3D PUZZLE, I gave it a chance.In short, it was the best 3D puzzle experience I have ever had. It only took me about 90 minutes to build the entire thing. The pieces are sturdy and durable and when you have the correct pieces, they snap into place perfectly. When I finished building the puzzle, I felt that I had actually accomplished something.The backs of each piece are numbered so that building this puzzle is more akin to building a model or a painting a paint-by-number picture than putting together a tradition puzzle. I had no issue with that. However, many people who put puzzles together or purists and I can understand why they would not want to have any numbers on the back to help them. You could get around that with this puzzle by whiting out the numbers on the backs of the pieces. It would take time to do, but would allow you to put together this fine 3D puzzle without cheating.Personally, I found the top pieces of Big Ben to be the most difficult to put together. Any pieces on a corner or seam are hinged and you have to have all of the pieces hinged at the correct angle for everything to snap together. Even though all of the pieces are numbered, I spent much more time putting together the top section of this puzzle than I thought I would have.Overall, the RAVENSBURGER BIG BEN 3D PUZZLE is an item that's a lot of fun to put together. It would be a great item that a parent and a child could work on together. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I got this puzzle through the Amazon Vine program to review.  I had never done a 3D puzzle before and was excited to try one out.All of the pieces are numbered with arrows so you know what order to put them in and where they click together. The puzzle is put together in three sections; the bottom tower, the clock portion of the tower, and the steeple.  The instructions tell you which numbers of pieces go into which section.I am still not sure how I feel about the numbered pieces, it makes the puzzle much easier to put together...but you also don't get the fun of puzzling the picture together.  There are two frame pieces that are put between the sections and these give nice stability to the tower.The puzzle pieces are hard plastic, the corner pieces are hinged.  This gives the tower more durability but makes it hard to bend the pieces in place at the top of the tower.  It you push the pieces too hard they have a tendency to pop out in other places in the tower.The top portion, the steeple, was incredibly tough to put together.  The pieces are under a lot of stress and as soon as you get one piece lined up another piece would pop back out.  It was very frustrating and in the end the pieces still aren't lines up completely right.Overall this was a fun puzzle, it stays together well after being put together and was very quick to put together.  The steeple portion of the puzzle is a bit frustrating because you would put in one piece and another portion would pop apart.  I have fairly small fingers and still had trouble reaching in the steeple to get the pieces together.  Outside of the steeple portion I really enjoyed putting this piece together and would recommend to those who enjoy this kind of numbered 3D puzzle. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My family are avid puzzlers, so I knew this would be a little on the easy side. It was quick to put together. The image quality and detail are nice, and the pieces snap together well enough to be secure without gluing.Like other 3D puzzles from Ravensburger, the last few pieces can be tricky to fit.The things I didn't like about this puzzle is that I wish it had something about the history of Big Ben to make it more educational for it's intended audience and I wish it had some other type of base. The base is the least secure part of the puzzle, so much so that I opted to display it without the base.My overall impression is still very good, and if you have family members who are enthused about British history and monuments, they will love it. My daughter certainly thought it was nifty. [SEP]","[CLS] Ravensburger has been making toys for the hand, head, and heart for over 130 years.

B004O0TOJK,"[CLS] This 3D puzzle is quite a challenge to build. With 216 tiny pieces, some of which have trouble interlocking with their comrades, it took my son and me several hours to build it, much of the time rebuilding parts that had fallen apart when we tried to fit them with the rest.  The pieces are numbered, like other Ravensburger 3D sets, so that helps.Even though the building process was a little unnecessarily too tedious, the finished product looks awesome!

[SEP]"",""[CLS] I was impressed with this building set.  It's for ages 10 and up, but my 8 year old put it together.  The pieces are plastic and curved.  They are numbered from 1-216 and something.  The most time consuming part was searching for the next consecutive number to continue.  The pieces were easy to attach to one another, and the lighthouse was quite sturdy when it was finished. Once you complete one row, there's an arrow on the puzzle piece that tells you to build the next piece upward to begin the next row.  It was simple constructing. It includes the upper portion or the decking of the lighthouse and the cone on top, it sets right into place during construction. This lighthouse you will be able to display.

I think the light brick is made in China as almost all Lego sets with electronic components contain components made in China, if anyone cares. This is probably not a good set to collect in MISB form until your kids grow old enough to play with it because the batteries in the light brick might die or worse, leak... Lego instruction says uses two LR41 watch or button batteries although we haven't tried opening our light bricks yet. Highly recommended. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I have traveled this state in search of lighthouses. now i have on on my shelf.this set is pretty nice. comes with a rotaing lens and a lightbrick to shine off of it.you really, in pictures, only get to see one side. the back side has a handle to rotate the lens and the far side opens up to get inside. i don't understand the reasoning for that.there is a cool little power boat and minifig to go along with it and a pier to tie it up on.it is a simple build and from the lego creator, it is the tough one of the three. i wn't be doing the other two because i love the lightouse. it looks really cool [SEP]"",""[CLS] **Update early 2013: this set is now discontinued and the price is rising. For value, I recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Lego-Log-Cabin/dp/B004478GGK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Lego Log Cabin</a>&nbsp;while supplies last. There are three Creator structures slated for 2013, a small cottage, a treehouse, and a family house.**I think this is one of the best sets of 2011. This is a creative, original design that is fun to build and play with.-This is, as far as I can tell, Lego's first dedicated lighthouse. There have been other lighthouse-like structures (e.g. the Coast Guard command tower from a few years ago). And there is a small polybag set, #30023, that just came out; but that is really a mini-version of this large one. So 5770 really is an original and unusual set. I wouldn't necessarily call it a collectors item, but I wouldn't expect another lighthouse for quite a few years.-Being from the Creator line, this set is made primarily out of general-use bricks and comes with instructions for three different builds. This is closer to how Lego was when I was a child, and it encourages kids to rebuild the structures either as the other designs or their own. The Creator sets, however, use more ingenious building techniques than what Lego offered decades ago. These are really marvels of miniature design. The other two designs are a sea-side restaurant (with a dock and a hinged side-wall for access), and a boat house with a launching ramp.-This set is on the expensive side for some people, but it is still a good value. All of these bricks are very useful in making your own designs, especially the red and white curved bricks and the slopes. And Amazon often goes below MSRP on these sets, so keep a look out (no pun intended).-This set has great playability. In fact, of the three Creator structures that came out this year (the others being 5771 and 5766) this one is the most fun. It has a light brick that you can spin with a crank that sticks out of the side of the tower (actually, the light brick remains still while you spin a reflector). One must push down on the top of the lighthouse in order to keep the light shining. Kids will either be taking the model into a closet, or insisting that you turn off all the lights so that they can play with this feature. In addition to the front door of the model, a portion of the side of the tower swings open to reveal a ladder. And there is the boat, mini-figure, smartly designed sea-birds, BBQ and fish. The other two models are very good as well.-The set is great for both boys and girls. It makes a great gift as well because if you don't like the design, you can still build it into something else.-If you find this set is on the expensive side for you, but you want some of the same design advantages that it has, check out the set #5766, the Log Cabin, which arrived in early 2011. Both are great sets. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The light brick and the revolving beacon make this set very special.  It even comes with a minifig -- unusual in LEGO creator sets.  The lighthouse has an arched door that opens and also one side that opens for access into the interior, plus directions to make a motorboat.  Fish and seagulls, too!The other two projects are a boathouse and a marina/observation station -- both fun, but not nearly the technical challenge of the lighthouse.Perfect set -- thirtybucks is the right price.** Update January 2013: one of my kids memorized Poe's poem The Raven.  Then the kids acted it out with this LEGO lighthouse set, plus two minifigs and 2 skeletons from the LEGO castle drawbridge defense 7079.<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Lego-Castle-7079/dp/B001V7RF9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Lego Castle 7079</a>&nbsp;The Raven was a seagull.

B004PBNGJM,"[CLS] Aww, I'm such a softie. I bought this lil' old greasy tow truck for my 3 year old on a whim. He's had so much fun with the simple Melisa & Doug semi trucks and farm train, and he's been a huge fan of flatbed tow trucks...This truck is quite a bit larger in scale than the other Melissa and Doug vehicles we own, and as a result it proved instantly more engaging. The bed of the truck pivots down to meet the floor, so the car can be hoisted on (no actual hoist provided -- you'll have to use your imagination), but the bed of the truck has grooves to keep the car from sliding off sideways, and a retractable plastic hook at the head end that latches into the underside of the car. And the car has a catch at both ends, so it can be put on facing either forward or reverse. That may seem like a minor point, but was a major talking point for our son.Another cute, simple toy from M&D that gets heavy applause from the primary user. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Put this in our 2 year olds easter basket, he doesnt eat candy, so he didn't get a chocolate bunny, he loved this toy and stilla t 3 plays with it regularly!  Thank you [SEP]"",""[CLS] I am a huge fan of Melissa & Doug stuff and my children have quite a few of their items.  Although this truck is of good quality in regard to the wood I am a little disappointed in the towing feature.  The car does not lock onto the bed as the description says and within 5 minutes of my 3.5 year old son playing with it he was in tears due to frustration as the car wouldn't stay!  I was able to get it to lock if I was very careful but as soon as my son sped off with it the car detached again.  Other than that, it is an alright toy but if that is a feature you are looking for it doesn't work very well.  I wouldn't buy again as it isn't exceptional in any way but my son does play with it still. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My son has a few other Melissa & Doug products and he loves to play with them. I love that they are wooden and look a lot like toys I played with in my childhood. I ordered him this truck and it lived up to the expectation I have come to have for their products. He loves to push it around the floor making beep beep sounds. At 20 months old he is already a big fan of trucks, cars and anything else that has wheels and will GO. This toy is perfect for growing a child's imagination. And I certainly don't think it is limited to little boys, girls would like to play with this too. I feel this will last a while, unlike some of the plastic junk he has. I will be buying other Melissa and Doug products in the future, that's for sure. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I have a car and truck enthusiast in my home. He has several M&D cars/trucks and received this one for his third bday. 2 cars in one - and the release button for the red car to come off of the flat bed tow is pretty cool too.

B004PHU8XI,"[CLS] I was recently given the chance to preview one of Hasbro's newest creations, a very LEGO-like line of toys called KRE-O. My preview came in the form of the 316 piece KRE-O Transformers Starscream Decepticon/Jet kit.The KRE-O Starscream comes with the aforementioned three hundred plus pieces, a thick instruction booklet (primarily full of photos), and one sheet of stickers that are applied during the construction of Starscream. It also comes with two figurines, a pilot for the jet version of Starscream and a mini version of everyone's favorite despicable Decepticon, the beloved Starscream.The pieces and instructions are photocopies of LEGO kits. There is very little difference at all. In fact, the KRE-O box hypes the fact that their pieces are interchangeable with leading brands of blocks. It is very much like purchasing a store brand or knock-off brand of LEGOs in order to save a few bucks without actually saving said bucks.With that said, however, Hasbro cut no corners in the quality of the pieces and in the finished product. You can build Starscream in his jet or robot form. Both creations include moveable parts, my favorites being the opening cockpit and retractable landing gear while Starscream is in jet mode.The attention to detail is brilliant. The figure has excellent weight and the stickers look very good.You CANNOT transform the jet into Starscream or vice versa. You must build each version of Starscream separately. If you wish to have a completed version of Starscream in jet version and in robot form, you'll need to buy two kits. However, if you enjoy the challenge of building and rebuilding both versions, you'll only need one kit to do this.I must admit that when this kit arrived in the mail, the twelve year old boy in me jumped to the front of the bus. I couldn't wait to tear the kit open and start building Starscream.If you have a child who enjoys Transformers and/or building LEGO kits, give the KRE-O Starscream a whirl. Hasbro has plans to release this kit and at least three others later this year. The other kits are Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and Megatron. According to HASBRO's website, there will be a total of twelve KRE-O Transformers released and all will vary in price and difficulty.Highly recommended. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Starscream is the coolest! Starscream is one of the best quality Kre-o sets in the line. This bad boy comes with awesome detail in robot or fighter jet mode. In robot mode there is great articulation in the arms,legs,body and the classic G1 style head piece. In fighter jet mode there is realistic detail from the cockpit and working landing gear to the turbine thrusters in the back. Starscream comes with some sweet weapons like the classic arm missiles and a arm cannon with firing projectile. I love how they did Starscream in the classic G1 style to make this Kre-o set even more kick-ass. Starscream comes with two kreons that are Starscream and a pilot. The poseability is outstanding with great stability for creating cool battle scenes or unique poses for displaying where you please. The durability is excellent as well with all pieces fitting securely together for a solid build in either robot or fighter jet mode. The Kre-o sets are a great idea that creates bonding time for a parent and child while being able to learn a creative construction process. The age level is 8-14 meaning Starscream is made more for the older age group. If you are a parent buying for a child of 5-6 or younger you will have to help in the construction process. Each mode will take 2-3 hours to build,but is totally worth the time when you have an amazing final product. Starscream has 316 pieces in which some are very small so you will need to be careful not to misplace any of them. Bottom line Starscream is a well-made,high quality,10 out of 10 Kre-o construction set that all transformer fans will enjoy. I highly recommend Starscream to all transformer fans and collectors out there. Starscream Rocks and Transformers Rule!!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Nephew got one as a gift, couldn't put it down till it was done, then broke it into pieces and reassembled the other way around.  Beats me, I have daughters, but I know the craze with the competitors' brand, starting with letter L and ending with O, has taken hold on our children in a major way, so I couldn't resist the temptation to try this myself.  The build process is addicting.  You need nerves of steel to look at the kazillion tiny pieces and get them to actually fit together to look the way the box picture appears.  The finished products are a foot tall (robot) and 13 long (jet fighter) and the feeling of achievement upon completion is spectacular.  Comes with two mini figures standing less than 2 high and they fit inside the finished builds.  Great for kids ages 8 and up, or for younger ones who have mastered the 300+ piece creations.

In comparison to the Little People bus (which we've had for 4 years now), the Sesame Street bus seems like it would break much easier.  The Little People bus is made out of heavier, more durable plastic.  If this bus is in a toy box and a heavier toy gets thrown on top of it, I could see it breaking.  The Little People Bus has pegs in it so the people don't fall over while the child is pushing it or carrying it around.  The Little People bus also makes some sounds, and this one does not.Bottom line:  It's Elmo and Sesame Street and that's what appeals to most kids.

B004SGHLXQ,"[CLS] I bought this for my 5 year old nephew, and my sister bought this for my 3 year old son. Both Christmas presents. They both loved them. It's really cool. The breathing that Darth Vador does, sounds exactly the same. And he says several phrases. The kids both loved this mask. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Let me state how much I love this mask right now. I have two 6 year olds, and this is one of their favorite toys right now. Remember the commercial where the young kid runs around the house trying to use the force on everything in sight? This is my everyday right now :) I will be cooking eggs in the morning before school, and one will pop around the corner wearing his mask, pressing the button to one of it's few phrases. So hilarious, and cracks me up everytime! We have bought it for birthday gifts for friends because we love it so much! Buy this along with a light saber for a young child and you will have endless laughter!The only bad thing I have found with it, is the plastic sides on it come off rather easy sometimes, and its a pain to get them snapped back in place. But overall, we love this mask! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Please note:  This review is being done by my husband, with input from our preteen son, as that is who I got it for.First and foremost, this is *not* a helmet.  It's a mask.  That was the first in a list of unhappy discoveries with this product.  The overall construction and design of the mask isn't all that great.  The flares on the outer edges aren't well secured to the main part of the mask, leaving open areas where you can see through to the two parts.  (Adding picture, have a look and you'll see what I mean.)  To replace the batteries, you have to remove the whole flare setup by unsnapping the plastic tabs securing it to the main section.  This means you have a fair chance of breaking it with every battery change.  Why they didn't put the opening for the battery compartment inside where it would be easy to get at, I have no idea.  The lenses in the mask are poor, neither darkly tinted nor giving clear vision.  They also scratch easily.  The sound effect button tends to stick in the depressed position if not pushed correctly, which causes the voice/breathing to go non-stop.  The voice effects themselves are obviously not directly from the movie recordings, but instead a voice actor.  It's close, but no cigar.  As is, I would rank it at 3 stars (just okay), but the price being asked for it causes it to lose yet another star.  Sorry, it's neither a helmet nor a good mask.  It's a pricey low quality mask.  As for our son, he does like it, but noticed right off that the voice wasn't right and the lenses didn't let him see clearly.  When asked what he thought it as worth, what he would pay for it, he gave back a figure less than half the asking price.  When asked if he thought the asking price was fair, he said no because the voice was wrong, it wasn't a full helmet, and there were hardly any sound effects. [SEP]"",""[CLS] When I first saw the STAR WARS DARTH VADER HELMET, I got really excited. A few years ago there was a Darth Vader Voice Changer Helmet that was for sale that when you placed it one it could synthesize your voice so that whatever you said would sound like Darth Vader. It sold for about $30-$50 and though I'm a Star Wars fan, I didn't have a lot of extra cash and just couldn't justify the cost. So, when the opportunity presented itself to get a new STAR WARS DARTH VADER HELMET, I couldn't pass it up. The packaging clearly states it's an electronic helmet and some of the advertising I've seen have promoted this as something that will let the person wearing it sound like Darth. That's only half-true. You can sound like Darth, but only because there is a button on the side of this mask that has a few pre-programmed Darth phrases that it repeats. Also, this isn't really a helmet, but a heavy-duty mask. A helmet fits completely over one's head. This is a mask that straps on the back. So, when wearing the STAR WARS DARTH VADER ELECTRONIC HELMET a person looks like Vader from the front, but from the back their head is exposed. For children, this is a high quality mask that isn't as bulky as a helmet and probably more enjoyable to wear and play with. However, for adults the STAR WARS DARTH VADER HELMET is a let down; it won't complete your costume and it won't allow you to sound like Vader and as far as collectibles go, the previously released Darth Vader Voice Changer Helmet is the way to go. Overall, great for kids, but not so much for grown-ups. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This Darth Vader helmet is really a mask, so first be aware that it will not sit on your head as well as you might have hoped.  I found it did not fit my adult face, but my kids had a blast putting it on.  The mask itself is thick durable plastic, but the shroud over the top (what you might call Darth Vader's helmet although it is still just half a head is really thin.  There are these little plastic tabs to hold it in, and they kept popping out during play.Inside the mask, there is a soft rubber nose pad and a soft forehead pad to add to comfort, nice touches in a plastic mask that could dig into your face.  The eye holes are covered in clear plastic windows, and they are surprisingly easy to see from.  Many masks can be difficult to see out of, and I did not have that problem with this mask.There is no voice changer here, just 8 phrases that are spoken when you push a button on the side of the toy.  It is powered by a single replaceable AA battery.  The back features 2 elastic side straps with a third that goes over the top of your head.  It seems to hold on pretty well, but not as a good as a full helmet would stay on.  This is for play around the house, not to go into a full costume.I also noticed that when I first received the mask, the price was over $40.  Now it is has dropped to closer to $25.  In my mind, it's not worth it at all for $40, but for $25 it could be a fun addition to a toy box for a Star Wars fan.  Of course the voice is not James Earl Jones, but it sounds close enough and kids will have fun with it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Finally, after over 30 years of waiting I now have my own Darth Vader talking mask.  I still remember sitting in a theater in 1977 watching the opening scene of Star Wars: A New Hope's opening scene...you see an expansive star field, the camera pans down, and you see the atmosphere and surface of Tatooine...after a short battle aboard Princess Leia's starship an image dressed in black flows into the walkway with a deep-throated breathing, it's the vaunted and feared Darth Vader.  Movie-going would never be the same again!This mask is, of course, not a movie-quality item, but it's really fun.  OK, call me a nerd, but it's fun.  The mask covers the front of the wearer's head and is held securely in place by two elastic velcro straps. One strap goes around the back of your head and the other one comes from the top of the mask and loops around the cross strap.The mask is obviously made for a child, though an adult can wear it for a short period of time before  the internal nose support becomes too uncomfortable.  Oh, it gets a bit steamy inside the mask after a while, too, but that's a small price to pay.There is a button in the side of the mask, and when you push it the mask produces either a very realistic Vader breathing noise or one of several classic Darth Vader quotes.  The voice is generated by 1 AA battery (included - nice!).  Just about everyone in the family has enjoyed a turn with the mask.  It gives the wearer a surprising sense of power.  Like I said, it's fun.As for Vader going green, I was extremely impressed with the packaging for this item.  The mask is protected by an open-faced cardboard box.  You know how many toys are secured to an open-faced box with copious amounts of those wire twist-ties and lots of tape?  Not so with this mask.  Hasbro opted to use only a few small pieces of tape to secure the box, and the mask was secured to the box with string, not wire twist-ties!  All the packaging is recyclable!  Yeah!All in all a 5-star experience.  All the kids who see it love it.  What's not to love...well, except that Vader is a dastardly Sith Lord and all :-D.Emjoy!

B004SKLU4I,"[CLS] My son loves this toy, he takes videos of everything.  He's 4.5 and needs a little help with getting the video on the laptop but otherwise does this by himself.  It's easy to operate and the video is better than expected.  Audio leaves much to be desired but considering it is coming from a matchbox car, I wasn't expecting much.  Hubby enjoys playing with this toy as much as as our son.  This is a great toy for an older boy (or girl).  It seems durable and so far has held up well.  It also comes with attachments for a bike, scooter, helmet, etc. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This racer was a hit in our house, especially for my 10 year old. Kids attached the holding strips to a remote-controlled car and to the Roomba vacuum, and had a blast with it. It was fun to see how our house looks like from that low point a view. The video is of acceptable quality, the sound is ok, too. It is not a super high tech camera, but it is quite adequate  for a toy. It seems to be build quite strong, perhaps a little too strong, since it was quite hard to open the camera holder. My husband had to do it for the kids. Also the backing on adhesive strip for the camera holder was quite hard to remove. The camera works like an USB storage device, so there is no need to install anything, just connect, copy the video files and start watching, very easy.

My 8 year old loves that he can drive this thing around the house and even make little mini-movies where they battle dinosaurs and what not.  Huge hit!  And it comes with a protector that can clip into an included wrist band or mounting bracket that can be put on a bike helmet.  Love it!

B004SKX8M0,"[CLS] Cool gun.  Got auto for it to be easier for the five year old. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Best part of this totally awesome Nerf gun is the distance the discs go!  My children received other Nerf guns for gifts so I kept this one for myself!  We've played both inside and outside with our Nerf guns and I've lost quite a few of the discs because they bounce off objects and walls and disappear under furniture.  After a search and rescue, we've managed to find them all.  There are a few things I'm not thrilled about: 1) the fact that it uses 6 1.5V C Batteries makes this, already very heavy - but durable, gun even heavier and 2) the replacement discs can be quite expensive (about $6 for 10).  So... I love the distance the discs fly but will make sure we're playing outside so we can easily locate the discs. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The interesting thing about this gun is that it runs off a flywheel system, with the automatic part being some sort of governor plunger that pushes discs into the flywheels at a set rate.  This gives the blaster a good reliable rate and range of fire, meaning that the learning curve is pretty simple.  The integrated handgaurd safety that powers up the flywheels was a clever design, I like it a lot more than the flywheel release on something like, say, the barricade.  That said, I would not recommend this gun to any hardcore nerfer.  The reason for this is that it doesn't really provide anything the Praxis or the Vigilon can't do for half the cost or less.  Basically the key killer for the Nitron is its rate of fire.  It fires about 1-1.5 discs per second.  This puts it in a weird position, since that's not fast enough to be something like a squad support blaster or a front man, but the weight of the 6 C-Batteries means that as a sniper it's too much excess weight.  The nature of the Nitron's automatic fire puts it in a position where it's not really better than any of the other guns in the series, despite being 20 bucks more AT MINIMUM.  That's really the only reason for the 3 star review:It's a fun gun, but it's really heavy and expensive for the things it can do.  If you wanna buy your child a blaster, go with the Vigilon or the Praxis, since both are good and reliable, and no matter what the blaster is the firing mechanism is the same for all of the non powered guns, so you're getting the same range.  Do NOT get the nitron, as it's sadly a waste of money for what you get.TO A MODDER HOWEVER, this blaster is amazing, because if you up the voltage with some good old fashioned Li-Ion 3.7V Batteries instead of the 6 1.5V C-Batteries, you can seriously up the speed of the flywheels, making them get up to speed faster, spin faster, and making the automated plunger fire faster as well.  Thus if you're confident in your abilities and are willing to spend the money, you can seriously improve this blaster, making it lighter, faster, and still having that crazy 55Ft range! But it really needs to be modded to shine, making it only practical for a hard core modder. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Besides hearing how awesome the gun was He told me all the things he liked and didn't like. Wasn't crazy about the orange and green and could see how others would change that. He thought the scope was very cool with the lights and all but totally useless to use. The gun well he loved the weight and feel once the batteries were in. He thought the disks were very cool and loved the power with which they left the gun. He was surprised by the delay when he started to fire but quickly got over that. He loved the gun thought Nerf had once again made a totally cool product.  So it was a big hit here. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I have three sons so they were super excited to try ot the Nerf Vortex Nitron.  They're pretty familiar with Nerf guns and have several of the smaller dart guns with the suction cups on the ends and one crossbow that shoots foam arrows.The Nerf Vortex Nitron is a BIG gun.  And sort of heavy, so be mindful of that when choosing it for a child.  I'm an average sized adult and could feel that it could be burdensome after carrying it around for awhile.  It also takes quite a few batteries, 4 C batteries to run the accelerator (the motor that pushes out the discs) and 2 AAA for the scope.The basic model comes with one magazine that has 20 discs in it. The discs are made of a very thin, lightweight plastic/foam combination that is the standard with Nerf products.  Don't be fooled, they still pack quite a sting if you're hit by one because there is quite a bit of force behind the launch of them!  Nothing that would put your eye out or anything, but it left a some red marks on my arm (and on my husband's head) after being hit by them from approximately 15 feet away.  Nothing permanent or that left a bruise, but it stung a little!  I don't think most teen boys would mind much, they'd probably see that as part of the fun.The scope is a little wobbly (it slides off and on) and has a green pulsing light on it that can be set to three stages: 1 for slow tracking, 2 for fast tracking, 3 for on.  There are little triangles that go from big to small and when they hit small, that's when you're supposed to pull the trigger.  We found that you actually had to pull it a second before in order for it to be accurate.  We finally ended up taking it off since it really didn't help much in the way of making the shots more accurate, it was more cool-looking than anything.  We found it annoying since it was wobbly and distracting when trying to play.This toy has two triggers and they must be pressed in order to release the discs, so you have to have some manual dexterity.The discs come in a magazine that slides into a chamber and holds 20 (twenty) discs at a time.  You can buy a second magazine that fits in the back for extended, uninterrupted shooting. Which, in theory, sounds good.  But in reality, it just means more discs to find and pick up.  And THAT is the reason for 3 stars - it takes FOREVER to find all of the discs because they bounce off of every surface and slide into spots you'd never think to look.  The first time we played with it, we shot it in the family room.  It took 15 seconds to unload the magazine and 20 minutes to find all of the discs to reload it again.  My kids played with this toy for about an hour before they got tired of constantly having to search for all of the discs, over & over, to reload.  They took it into the backyard to give it a try and found that they lost 4 of the 20 discs in the grass and unknown places.So, though the toy itself is very sturdy & solid, the shooting mechanism is a lot of fun (the discs shoot quite a distance), the length of time needed to re-load is tiresome & causes kids to lose interest quickly.  15-20 minutes of clean-up time maybe isn't worth 15 seconds of action.  I don't know any way around this or anything Nerf could have done differently to avoid this.  Maybe playing with it in an empty room (like a gymnasium or something similar) would be a good solution since there wouldn't be any furniture, shelves, lamps, etc. for the discs to hide under. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My kids and I have had a blast playing with this thing! Out of the box, it was easy to assemble and the instructions are very simple. Be prepared to buy some batteries. This gun takes 6 'C' batteries and 2'AAA' batteries to operate, which is why I gave it a 4-star and not 5-star rating. I think that is still a very reasonable amount of batteries to operate such a large gun, though. The magazine holds 20 nerf discs which are easy to load and fly very straight and far. The scope is not all that useful, but it looks really cool lit up-especially in the dark.Overall, this Nerf gun looks very impressive and is great to handle. It is a little large for smaller children, but my 11 and 12 year-old can handle it easily. The auto fire is smooth and very fast (about one shot per second). You can unload the 20-round magazine very quickly if you hold the trigger down for long. The gun comes with 20, which is fine to start with, but you will probably be needing to buy more very soon if your kids like to have nerf wars like mine do. They are bright green, which makes them easy to find in the house, but outdoors can be a little trickier to locate. Overall, this gun is a great toy and a lot of fun for boys of all ages!

B004T0CQ0Y,"[CLS] This toy is lots of fun for everyone in the family who can keep a tune or not. Although, rated for an 8+ yr old, my 4 yr old loves it (especially the free included Needle Dropper - Check It Out tune.  I downloaded the free Paper Jamz Pro series Windows app so I could put my own tunes on the box. The app is easy to use and very friendly. This app includes 10 free songs (8 new ones + the 2 included w/the purchase). The very 1st song I uploaded to the library was The B-52's: Love Shack. I quickly discovered that a 5:21 min song can't be put on the device, it won't let you. I tried converting the mp3 to lower quality to make the memory footprint smaller, but that didn't matter. The longest song length in the Paper Jamz library is 3:37 min. The max song length limitation is not stated in the manual or anywhere I could find. Hope your fav tune isn't too long.After enjoying the unit for an hour, the microphone started cutting in & out. The problem was two fold. 1) The internal microphone connector was not always making adequate contact with the microphone jack (wiggling it helped but this shouldn't have to been done so frequently), 2) the microphone cable itself developed some dead spots from the wire moving around (too bad they used cheap wire for this critical component).The voice effects on the unit are fun to play with and will entertain everyone. The mic & music volume are easy to adjust and have ample loudness.Overall, I wouldn't rate this device a PRO SERIES quality unit as printed on the box, but rather a TOY SERIES quality unit. Also, it would have been much nicer if the device could hold more songs, say six songs instead of three. Many times its just fun listening to songs (MP3 player) and not singing.Update 1 (after a few days use):Upon further use, I added some Velcro to the mic and base unit (Amp) so that the mic could clip onto the Amp when not in use. Too bad the belt clip couldn't double as a stand for the Amp. Often, one doesn't want to wear the Amp, but rather one just wants to sit down, sing, then give the device to someone else for a shot. A new irritating quirk has developed on power-up. The Amp sometime squeals an awful hi-freq tone (not mic feedback). One must repeatedly power cycle the unit to get it back into a normal state. (the batteries are fully charged).Update 2 (after 1 week):The unit started not turning on immediately when powered on. It just appears dead for a minute, then it comes to 'life', sometimes. By 'life', I mean a few LED's are lit up, or the previous quirk occurs, but generally no response to button presses nor any sound output. After power cycling for a few minutes, then it starts working... almost... the device randomly stops playing songs... it's like it needs a 15 minute warm-up now... Ok, this is getting old, I am going to return this device to the store and try something else. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This little box is fantastic. It sounds great and my son loves it. You can use it as a plane microphone, with stored music (3 songs), or with the simple sound effects it has built in. It works on 4 AA batteries. It could not be easier to use and installing you own songs is simple with the software available at the website. I was able to install songs from iTunes without an issue.You do have to use the USB cord that came with the device and not a standard cable. A standard USB cable of the same size did not work and the device was not recognized by the software.My only complaint is that the cord is too short. I just ordered a 12 foot extender so the speaker can be on the ground instead of my son having to hold it or clip it to his waist.I just ordered a second as backup! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Junk.

It was pretty simple, just download the app from the paper jams web site and then plug in the toy. Then it's just import, drag and drop. The kids love singing and dancing with this toy! The only con I've found is that you get some feedback when the microphone gets too close to the speaker. But, if they clip the speaker on their belt, it holds it far enough from the mic not to be a problem.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] My 8 year old niece got this as an early Christmas present. She loved it.  I might add my husband also spent a fair bit of time playing with it...The device is little smaller than a hardcover book. The microphone is attached and has bout 3 feet of cord.  The child can choose different options, it has a few songs they can play and sing to, or they can just have it play the melody, or they can use it with music. It will also autotune their voice.  They can use it to modify their voice to sound really deep (my husband's favorite feature).  From an 8 year olds perspective, it sounds really cool and makes them sound a lot like current music.However, the short distance of the cord means unless the child understands they need to hold the mic right up to their mouth and speak quietly, you are basically listening to both them yelling and the modified voice.For what it is and for the price and for the ages of maybe 6 to 11, I give this 4 stars.  If you have an older child who wants something they can really create music with - look elsewhere.  The options are limited, the songs are very limited (there were only 3 song buttons) - it definitely isn't for someone serious about music.Now, from a parent perspective, I'm going to give this one star.  We were only visiting and I was already sick of it after listening to it for a few minutes.  It gets pretty loud - probably a great feature from the kids perspective, but really annoying as an adult.  So, if you have a small living space where you can't send the child elsewhere to play with it, or you don't have a very high tolerance for that kind of stuff, pass on this, at least for your own child!

We haven't tried the night portion yet as we've only had it a few days.  He might struggle with that a bit, but once he gets the hang of it he'll enjoy it.

It is a great project.  My 4 year old and 5 year old both enjoy it as well, though finding it much easier to accomplish, they still may get one piece not the correct way, where we tell them You have one piece that is not the same as the picture and it can be challenging for them to figure out which one.

A couple of days past her birthday and she is already through all the cards, including the night time. She never got into jigsaw puzzle, so it made me really happy that she loved this! I also bought the Smart Car which is a little more her level. She hasn't figured out that the eyes are part of the puzzle, so she still has to work quite hard with that one.I will not get it out for her to do on her own as she really wants our approval and attention, so we usually sit down together which she loves.The quality of this toy is great, the only negative is that it doesn't store in the box, which is a bummer. The Smart Car fits nicely back in the box.Little brother is 15 month, and he loves to just stack the blocks, when his sister is not playing with it.These are the first two games I have bought from SmartGames, and I am over the moon happy with them.

B004U5RD1A,"[CLS] I seem to fall into the realm of how almost everybody else on BGG feels about this game.  I bought it because it seemed like a fun concept; Dominion with dice?  I love Dominion and I love rolling dice!  But once I played it, it was just a little too simple and on-rails for me.  What everyone else says about it is exactly right.  The first player to buy the biggest creature wins the game.  The one thing that it does have going for it is that it is a quick game that people can play in about 20 minutes while waiting for others to show up. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I thought this was a fun Deck builder, but after playing Magic for years, I found this to be too light a version and too random. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My wife and I have been trying different board games lately, and I stumbled on Quarriors pretty much by accident.  I actually saw it listed on another site where they said it was great simply because it came with so many dice.  I came to Amazon and saw some good reviews, and noticed how well put together the actual package looked.I ordered it for a good price, and it came very quickly as does everything from Amazon.My wife and I got a chance to play it finally, and it was definitely fun.Let me start by saying that we are NOT gamers.  Games like this don't come naturally to us, so at first while reading through the instructions we were both a bit concerned that it was going to be confusing.  Not to worry, it's not.  Once you actually start playing the game, it becomes very easy to understand.The game was a lot of fun.  It's quick to play, and there is a little strategy involved.  Don't get me wrong, it doesn't have the level of strategy that a game like Risk or Axis and Allies would have, but it's got it's own strategic element.  I have read that some people don't like how there is a lot of luck involved in the game compared to the amount of strategy, and I can see where they are coming from.  There is a lot of randomness to what can happen...you randomly set out monsters in the Wilds at the start of the game, you randomly draw dice from your bag, and you randomly roll those dice.  However, I don't think that means that there isn't any strategy involved.  It just means you need to adjust your strategy on the fly to the conditions that have been given to you.For being a couple of people that don't play a ton of games, but who are trying to start playing them, this game really hit a home run with us.  We had a lot of fun playing it and are looking forward to our next game night.A few quick notes on the production values of the game itself.  The art on the cards is very nice, the dice are VERY nice looking, and the tin that the whole thing is packaged in looks great on the shelf.  Overall, the whole package is very nice!!! [SEP]"",""[CLS] So I have always been a fan of roleplaying and strategy games, not as much card and dice, unless they are included in that mix.  I go to a local Game Shop on Friday nights to game it up with friends, and they Demo games every Friday, last night it was Quarriors due to its recent expansion, and I had a fun time quickly learning the rules of the game and playing it.  What I love about this game is that it constantly changes!  Each game, you shuffle the monster and spell decks, creating constant variations for constantly differing gameplays, and with expansion packs, the gameplay differences are neverending, especially with different players and strategies each time.On each turn you roll 6 die, and everyone starts off the the same basic, 12 die (8 basic Quiddity to buy Monsters and Spells with, and 4 Basic Monster Die).  When you roll, you can then use your Quiddity to buy new Monsters or Spells or a Portal from the card layout of Die, depending on how many Quid you rolled, or pay to Summon a Monster if you rolled one.  Each Monster has its Stats as follows, Upper left corner - amount of Quid to summon, upper right corner, amount of attack, lower right corner, defense.  If you rolls spells You choose which Monster to attach spells to, if none summoned you can place these in your active area until a later turn when rolled.  Once your Monsters are activated, they automatically go around and attack everyone else's monsters, and depending on their defense, even when tied, attacker always wins.  This is where certains spells and Monster abilities (as noted on the cards) come into play.  Sometimes when a Monster is defeated, for example, it immediately goes into that player's active pile, and gets to be rolled on their next turn in addition to their other 6 die, so there are a lot of great bonuses to this game!Now, once everyone takes their turn and its back to you, if you have any Monster's remaining, your player piece (the little color representing you and your bag), goes ahead one spot on the Glory Board, and this is how the score is kept.  Now there are some Monsters that give you extra Glory, if they defeat any opponet's Monsters that turn, for example, you will receive an extra Glory point (maximum of one extra per turn), but it can really add up!  Depending on how many players (2-4) depends on how many Glory points you need to win.  Also if 4 Monster cards are cleared of their Monster die at any point during the game the game is over and the player with the most points wins.  You can only buy one die per turn (but sometimes there are also exceptions to that rule).PROS:High ReplayabilityGame is constantly changingExpansion packs to buy to keep it interesting and freshBUT you don't ever NEED to buy these expansion packs, you can buy the game alone and be fineEasy to learn, even with all the rules and so much going on, everything you need to know is written on the cards and can be explained as you go (I caught on RIGHT AWAY, and was able to later that night TEACH my D&D group after playing with a totally different group, and they also caught on right away!)Includes everything you need in the cool tin and has it all organized with a place for everything and everything in its place!CONS:My only thought was I wished more than 4 people could play, and later when I asked the people in my D&D group what THEY thought of the game, they expressed they loved it but wished more people could play as well!  (Though at the shop we had two games going simultaneously and had a mini-tournament going on, and that was a lot of fun, it would be great if up to 8 people could play this!)Aside from that, there really is nothing else I can say negative about this!  At one point I commented on the pretty pink dice and one of the guys at the table said something along the lines of, Now I KNOW there's a girl here!  LOL, but hey, thats why they make PINK, right?  The dice are really high quality, and the art on the cards is as well.  The bags are a little stiff at first (in the set I bought), but the ones we played with at shop were well broken in so they were nothing like that at all.  The shop also had little player-mats I wish were included with the game which had an active area for the Monsters summoned, inactive area for discarded die, and ready area for die to roll on next turn.  I'm not sure where I can get a mat like that, and my friend commented it would be even better if it was made of the material mousepads are made of, and I agreed, but it wasn't included with the base set.  Maybe that comes with the expansion?  But I have no idea.  I really prefer playing with it, though.  It tells you the order of your turn on it, as well.Highly recommended to gamers everywhere!

B004UC4N1G,"[CLS] My feelings about this product are mixed -- We've long been fans of Scrabble, and thought we'd shake things up a bit by trying a different variation of the game. The Electronic Turbo Slam device, first required (3)- AAA batteries (not included). The device, when slammed has pretty loud sound effects/music, which I found annoying after a short while.  I also thought there was too much commotion for me with everyone trying to slap down cards to change the letters, and I wasn't crazy about making just (4) letter words.  As an adult, baby boomer, I much prefer the standard game of Scrabble -- quiet, relaxed and educational, and with more word potential.I can see that this would be a great game for parents to play with young children to help them get interested in learning new words -- I would use it as an educational tool, instead of having them feel pressured to make words at record speed.On the other hand, the speed and noise factor, would probably appeal to lots of teens.  Overall, the game is relatively inexpensive, and worth a try for families who enjoy word faster paced, action filled games.

By the time I get everyone to agree to play a game they have no patience to wait around while I set one up. Scrabble Turbo Slam is ready to go. The instructions are simple and easy to understand. Overall we had a good time playing this game and have played it a few times since getting it. I think this would make a great holiday gift for people that are difficult to buy for. Its been a crowd pleaser in our house. We get the fun and challenge of scrabble without the set up, and time commitment. [SEP]"",""[CLS] As a Scrabble Slam owner and fan, I was really interested in trying this new twist on the game! If you haven't played the original card game before, here's a little overview. In Scrabble Slam (the original game), prior to play, four cards are placed in the middle of the table, spelling a common word. The game then begins. Without taking turns, players each hold an equal fraction of the card deck, and change that word one letter at a time, going as quickly as they can and calling out each new word as it is formed. Each card has two sides, and either side/letter can be played. The first person out of cards wins the game. Depending on the players' skill level, it can be fast-paced and chaotic--or frustrating as you struggle to think of words!Scrabble Turbo Slam takes the same game, but changes a couple aspects of gameplay. The most obvious is that there's something else to pay attention to with the new electronic centerpiece. It blinks (and plays music--but thankfully you can turn this feature off!), and at random times it will make a noise. The first person to slam the large button at the top of the unit after hearing this prompt is allowed to take an action card, as the unit goes into pause mode and waits for gameplay to resume.That comes to the second big change--the inclusion of action cards. The action cards can be positive (such as giving cards to others or removing them from gameplay altogether)--or negative (getting them yourself!). What I really appreciate about the electronic unit and action cards being added to the game is that they provide possibilities for players to lose cards due to speed, rather than merely through word-creating skill. In the original game, if one person had better word-creating skills, the other player(s) might be left holding the cards . . .literally. With the new action cards, those with less word-creating skills than others, but better reaction times, can still have a chance at lightening their hand.The unit itself is made of plastic, and has a handy self-contained slide-out drawer for card and instructions storage. The sound is a trifle loud on the unit, but it has a visible speaker that could be covered in order to muffle the volume. It requires three AAA batteries, which are not included.I probably prefer this version of the game to the original. One of the nice features about it, too, is that this set's cards can be used to play the more basic version of the game, just by excluding the turbo unit and action cards. As to whether or not it lives up to the word Turbo, I feel that it instead calms the pace of the game down a bit. Because the unit pauses until the top button is tapped again, players have regular chances to look at their cards and catch their breath! [SEP]","[CLS] How fast can you create words? Slap down cards to change the words on the table. Then, slam fast when you hear the turbo sound from the Turbo Slam unit. If you slam first, grab an action card. Whats in store for you?

B004UUKMUE,"[CLS] I got this for one of my daughter's playdates. They had fun, especially since both girls have a couple of Barbie's between them. The set itself is fairly basic. As described on the product page, the set comes with one Barbie doll, 6 barrettes (which can be used on the doll or on the girls), and 16 printable hair extensions.Since my daughter and her friend are only first graders, they needed my help with this `project'. The designing is done online and with multiple options to choose from, the kids were happily engaged in choosing a design they liked. Just follow the instructions, print, peel off, and clip onto the doll's hair or a child's, and that's it. I do have to say that the hair extensions feel like real hair, nice and soft!It is a novel idea, and kept them occupied for some time, but honestly at this age, their attention span is quite limited, and they were soon off doing other things. Older girls might get more out of this. It is a cute idea though and a fun, creative project for girls.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] DISCLAIMER: My daughter LOVES Barbie.Another disclaimer: she also is a girly-girl :).So my seven year old Barbie lover saw the commercial for this and just HAD to have it. She loves Barbie and she loves the idea of doing her hair and has been begging for extensions, which mom is too mean to give her (she's 7). But this was the perfect solution! Firstly she loved the doll - she looks rocker-chic and that's always a cool thing to look like! What we were curious about, though, was how this would work, so we immediately got online and started designing!Firstly, the designing is pretty easy. Just drag and drop and you can adjust - simple for my tech-savvy 7 year old. Then you just print straight onto the hair! I thought it was crazy at first but honestly, it works, and the hair is much softer than you may think. Give it a bit of time to dry and then it's all set! We connected the hair to Barbie and it stayed on pretty well. We used the clip to connect it to my daughter's hair and since she has pretty fine hair it didn't stay on perfectly, but she was so happy that she had no problem putting it in any time it came out.We haven't played with it with friends yet, and the only con for me is the fact that you have to buy more hair extensions (I think that's a great thing to use her allowance money on!) but other then that, this is definitely a great idea! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I'd recommend this Barbie for girls ages 4+. my daughter who is 4 got a kick out of it, mostly because she could make her own hair extensions, not so much because of the doll. I'd be even better i think for a 6 or 7 year old who could fully take on this barbie set without much adult help. There are a lot of choices for the hair extensions and they're easy to make, you just need to set aside 15-20 to make one for your kid if they are not able to. I feel as though the price is a little steep, $8-10 cheaper and it would be a perfect gift. My daughters friends also went crazy over these, lately there has been a fascination with hair extensions because of the movie Tangled, and girls have been wearing the bright, single colored extensions, but she is able to mix it up a bit with these. Cute toy, but only till you run out of extensions. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My daughter was over the moon for the doll. What's not to like? Its Barbie, with rockin' pants and a awesome silver belt, big ol' earrings and a very cool hot pink and black streak in her hair. The other comment from my 8 year old was how very long this Barbie's hair is! So right there, its worth maybe $15. Add the printable hair stuff and I'd give you $20-25 tops.My daughter actually got onto the Barbie site herself. She poked through the designs before I even got around to it. So once I popped on, she was a pro. I was super impressed as she found the site, clicked through to the hair designing part and started going for it. She clicked on 4 different prints, resized and places each one. Then she found an icon that was a pink heart and resized and placed 2 of them. When she has finally finished a hair extension for both her and the Barbie, it was my job to load the paper, which is made extra easy with big, red arrows pointing you toward the correct way to load the printer.We crossed our fingers, clicked print and waited. IT WAS FAST! I peeled both extensions off the backing (after the 15 seconds it took to dry) and there it was, exactly like the ones she designed. The neato factor only lasted so long, but its pretty cool how it works.The practical application isn't so awesome. The extensions are hard to get seated on and remain on the clips that allow you to keep them in your (of course I mean your child's) hair and the smaller version that goes into Barbie's hair. The clips don't stay in well at all, either. We both did one and then they sat on the box on the steps for a while, waiting to be taken back up to her room.She has never asked to do it again, leading me to think this isn't something we will do more than the one time, or if a friend comes over just for giggles. The box comes with 8 sheets, with each sheet containing one large and one small hair extension. There are 6 clips total, 4 large and 2 small. I don't think we'll be needing to order extra hair strips anytime soon. But she is still playing with the doll!

This Barbie doll with designable hair comes complete with all you need to create colorful and pretty, unique hair extensions with the help of an inkjet printer. Go to the web site as instructed where you choose from 100's of designs (or upload a photo for more choices) and then customize your hair extension.  Print the sheet and it's ready to wear.  The box comes with 6 hair clips, 16 starter hair extensions (you can buy more separately for around $15 bucks) and a Barbie doll.  Her hair has a permanent streak of hot pink and black on one side, dangle earrings and a glitter halter top and pink pants with funky belt.  Your girls will love her.  Just make sure you have an inkjet printer since this is the only way you can print out the extensions.  We used one for the first time at a friend's birthday party and the girls had so much fun! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My daughter just about died when she saw this come in the mail yesterday! Barbie is so cool now a days!!! This Barbie comes with 16 hair extentions, 6 hair clips and one doll complete with a pink feather in her hair. You can design over 100 extensions online, but hopefully with all this design opportunities you can find replacement extensions so you can actually make that many, but that leaves you lots to choose from before printing them. You can print your own extensions with your own inkjet printer, it's so easy, they come on a piece of paper you just load your printer with. They are silky soft too.  Intel 1.5 GHz processor or equivealent required. Plus 256 MB of RAM, 64 MB of graphics memory, Adobe Flash PC/MAC compatible. Length of extensions approximately 9 and a half inches long. The streak in the Barbie's hair is permanent, but you also add other extensions to her hair, which is fun. Recommented for girls ages 6 and up, with adult supervision. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I got this for my daughter. She was thrilled when she saw it. I was thrilled trying to get it out of the box. Be careful with the hair, it's more fragile than you think, and since you need to feed it through an ink jet printer, so if you mess it up, the design will not come out right. This is my reason for deducting a star, well, half a star. I did not deduct for the hooochieness, though I was SO tempted! :-)Seriously though, this really held her attention. The hair extensions are kind of combable if you are careful and if they are not printed on. Combing them after they are printed is possible but carefully....So, you need a printer, and an internet conenction to make your designs, though I suspect you could print out anything as if it were on a strip of paper. I guess you could use magic marker.....but I wouldn't. My daughter is 6.5 and plays with it for a LONG time. If your daughter loves Barbies, and loves doing their hair, she will LOVE this! 4.5 stars.

B004VPQEAU,"[CLS] As a true Farkle enthusiast, this game has a nice twist to it.  All the Farkle games that are a spinoff of the original game give Farkle a variety of twists to keep it interesting. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I love Farkle, but my family members had never played. This looked like a fun game for family game night, especially as everyone gets to play all at once. Set up was simple and we played a few rounds slowly to get the gist. We made our own rules (how many points to aim for, how many rolls per set) and off we went. Everyone enjoyed the game, but the adding each round in your head was a bit challenging for the younger players. Overall we had fun, but I don't see this as being the first game we reach for when deciding what to play. The pros - easy to set up, different colored die, individual cards to help each player remember what's what as far as scoring goes and you can tweak the rules if you've got players with differing math skills playing. The cons - the whole tower set-up feels flimsy, the orange die look too much like the red die (yellow would have been a better choice), there's no scoring pads included, and once you get the tower put together, it doesn't like to come back apart. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My husband and I had a fun time playing this with our 9 and 7 year old daughters. Our 9 nine year old caught on quickly and needed no help but our 7 year old did need to team up with me a bit before she was able to play on her own. We had no problems with the popper not working as some other reviewers did. I will say though that my kids have not asked to play again after playing that first time so I don't think this is something I would buy for someone else. [SEP]"",""[CLS] There was a time when I was addicted to Farkle.  I would play the online version of it constantly.  When I saw that they had this available, I snatched it up because the idea of playing Farkle at home with family and friends appealed to me vastly.  Farkle is a pretty easy concept to pick up.  Once you play through a round, everyone involved knows what to do so there are no worries about someone not picking it up, and the score sheets provided are helpful for figuring out what combination of dice is worth something.  Farkle is certainly a game of chance, and a lot can be said for the frustration that comes from rolling a Farkle (BUST!) but it's so much fun taking that chance.  I like the setup to this version of the game, with the tower and the universal die at the top of the tower (in the bubble) and the gameplay changes are minor enough to make the game a tad more exciting.  The tower is not very well made though.  The plastic is flimsy and hard to connect to the base and so the tower all-assembled wobbles.  If you enjoy Farkle in its present state, try this on for size.  If you have never played the game then dig in.  This is fun for everyone! [SEP]"",""[CLS] This game is fun for a group to play, it has to be more than 2 people.  In a group/family setting it is more fun.  I found the directions a little quirky, and some didn't make much sense.  This game says 8+ but I would suspect that adult assistance is needed with scoring on this game due to the directions.  We have the original farkel game and we really enjoy it.  It is nice to have a different version to play every now and then though. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My friends and I are big fans of the original Farkle, so I was very excited about this variation. In this version, up to four players sit around a a tower with a die in the center. The die functions as the sixth die in the Farkle roll, but instead of being a standard die, it has only 1's, 5's and a few special sides (2X, wild, etc.). At the beginning of each round, one player rolls the extra die. Players take turns rolling their dice until they either Farkle, hold or fill the ramp leading to the top. Play for each round ends when either everyone has Farkled or finished, or someone has made it to the top. The game is over when someone has reached 10,000.It seems easy enough, but getting to 10,000 is difficult. First of all, the rolls aren't cumulative, just as in the regular game. You can only use the sixth die in the first roll, so it is almost impossible to get anything outside of ones and fives to score. You always have to play one die per roll, so getting any kind of run or multiples is very difficult. Secondly, good combinations don't earn as many points as in the regular game. Considering it is harder to score in this version, we got bored long before we finished any full games.Lastly, play is supposed to end when someone reaches the top, but then the game rules say that you can keep rolling at the top if you choose to. It doesn't make a lot of sense.This game has potential, but in the end, it isn't as much fun as the original (and much cheaper) game. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My family enjoys the regular Farkle game very much, so we were excited to try this new version.  The pop-o-matic is a fun memory from my childhood and my kids embraced it as well.  The frenzy of rushing to score at the same time proves pretty exciting to my 9 and 11 year olds who often get fierce with competition.  The 10,000 point win is difficult to achieve so we modify it as needed.  All and all, it's a pretty good game, but I would recommend sticking with ages 9 and up. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I have a 5 and 7 year old, and they are not quite ready for this (most games rated 8+ seem to work fine for my 7 YO though).I like Farkle (the original), and this adds some cool aspects to the game.Positives+ great educational value for learning math skills and also+ feels fast(er) than regular Farkle+ good strategic thinking as you figure out what risk taking you want to makeNegatives- confusing at first, but pretty workable once you learn it- plastic popup dice bubble's action is a little weird.  It gets stuck from time to time, but hasn't broken so far- not so portable (but that's ok - regular Farkle is pretty portable, Frenzy is not.  Just good to remember if you are ordering this and think you'll take it with you!)- Scoring system is definitely an educational challenge, and I am not sure all 8 year olds can do it.  I handled the scoring :)Overall, 4 stars and think it will get better with time as my kids get older, as long as the popper doesn't break :) [SEP]","[CLS] Farkle Frenzy adds an exciting new dimension to Patch's classic Farkle dice game!

B004VUX5XO,"[CLS] Seems like the dumbest game.  Mattel must have been grasping at straws to come up with a game on this one.  It has 20 power cards and 36 gird cards.  You roll the dice and try to decipher the pictures on the dice and knock out cards from your stack, which has to be in the order you laid them down.  Whoever runs out of card first then has to try to knock over the cardboard green pig by thumping one of the dice at him.  If he misses, the game continues...blah, blah...so dumb.

(They are 7 and 10.) It was too simple and they lost interest in it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I hesitated to give my review after reading other people's reviews of this being fun and easy to follow. I read the directions on how to play several times and found the game boring and mundane and frankly the directions were a little confusing. I had anticipated this game to be a version of UNO, or Old Maid or something but it was indeed its own unique game. I think the big problem was that I had figured out the game and played it a few times and the games went by really, really fast so I assumed I had missed something in the directions.  My four year old enjoyed playing it for about an hour but I would have been much happier with a regular deck of cards. The cards themselves looked pretty tragic after the camping trip and are not the nice stock of traditional playing cards. I know these cards are not the price level where you have to really deliberate but if you are looking at this item as a sole game to pass any considerable amount of time like camping in the rain or a two hour wait at a doctor's office keep a child occupied I would suggest sticking to something more tried and true. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 6 year old son got this as an early Christmas present.HOW IT WORKS:The game as two sets of cards, the power cards and the structure cards.  Each person draws 6 structure cards and chooses how to line them up in a stack and each person starts with two power cards. On your turn you roll the dice, you need to roll the bird on the structure card at the bottom of your stack to remove it (knock it out). The structure cards are either a bird or a pig.  If its a bird you have to roll the color of the bird on one of the dice.  If its a pig you have to roll two of the same color bird.  The dice have 5 different colored birds and a wild side with all the birds on them. If you fail to knock out a structure you get to take a power card.  The power cards let you either give the opponent one of your pig cards, make the opponent take a new structure card or force a re-roll (either for you or your opponent).  When a person knocks out all their structure cards they then get a chance to try to knock down the cardboard standup pig by flicking the dice at it.  The first person to knock the pig down wins.PROS:Once you get through the slight complexities of the rules, the game is a fairly simple one. There isn't a lot of strategy, so my 6 year old was able to play with no problem.  It's mostly lucky, with some strategy around when you play the power cards.CONS:There isn't much here that is going to occupy an older child or adult.  Also, knocking down the pig is fairly simple for someone older and more coordinated but much harder for a younger child, so this somewhat unbalances the game in the favor of the older children if you have very varied ages.  One solution is to let the younger child put the pig closer.OVERALL:Not the most innovative or captivating game I've played, but I was pleased to find it wasn't just angry birds slapped on an existing game.  It is different and my son really seemed to like it.  My son took extra special glee in forcing me to re-roll when I had rolled to knock out my last structure card.  I would say this game is best for ages 5-10. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I have yet to meet someone who doesn't like the Angry Birds.

I'm kind of lukewarm about the minifigs because they stick out like a sore thumb, but the sonic screwdriver isn't bad.

They are not quite the quality of Lego, but they are compatible, and they look nice once they are assembled.  The only down side is they rely mostly on stickers for all the special emblems, rather than printing them on the blocks, which is not my preferred method, because over time, the stickers fall off (however, they do give you duplicate stickers for each set, assuming you can keep them in a safe place).

Whovians will love the Doctor and Amy minifigs (not traditional mfs, though) and, of course, the tiny Tardis (though it's bigger on the inside).What I like: It's Doctor Who. And Lego. Together. Pure awesomeness. The Tardis kit is very easy to assemble and the stickers have held up (though it's not played with; it just sits on my desk).What I don't like: It's not true Lego, the pieces are somewhat interchangeable. What that means is that the figs don't look like other themed Lego minifigs (e.g., Star Wars, Harry Potter, X-Men). However, they look very nice, with decent detail. The plastic parts in the Tardis isn't quite as sturdy as actual Legos - for whatever reason, they just don't feel right. But it's a sturdy little box when assembled. I'm not a fan of stickers on Legos - I'd have preferred a more pure approach, cleverly using bricks instead.While this is a cool little set, for the price here, I could never justify or recommend such a purchase.

B004WH8RFW,"[CLS] Got this for my sons 3rd birthday (which is Cars themed) because he said he wanted a cars race track, so I figured this would be good cause it will be easy for him to use and doesn't require a ton of batteries. The box is still closed because it's not his birthday yet but i have a feeling it will be a great toy. They show you the cars that come with the set out of the box and the quality of the cars look great. I love how it comes with Francesco Bernoulli being that we are Italian. I cannot wait to give this to my son.Follow up to this review: my son received his race track for his bday and is having a lot of fun with it. This toy is very durable, cars work great and made well. This track was easy to put together and easy to use. McQueen works great on this track. Francesco is ok on it, sometimes he can't make his way up the track, but I'm thinking it's the batteries because sometimes he works great on the track. I have to put new batteries in him, I had to put older ones in him because I ran out of new batteries. I recommend this toy because it's durable and fun. My son also likes to just make his hot wheels drive on this track also. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a super toy, so glad I purchased it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Huge hit with all three kids!!! The love their shake and go cars and loved having something and somewhere to use them ! [SEP]"",""[CLS] The price on this track is terrible!  It really isn't that well made when it comes to all the accessory signs.  Mater falls off the brown part of the track.  Some of the other cars have as well. [SEP]"",""[CLS] If you've only got one kid, you'll probably like it more than those of us with two. Only one of the cars works with any reliability, and it's a super common issue.After buying this and having some issues, I decided to look up Amazon reviews to find that what I thought were fluke problems are common, known defects. Quality control isn't very good - the Francesco's are almost all defective.  When you read people complaining about how the cars don't go very far or work well - 9 times out of 10 it's Francesco and they just haven't caught on to the pattern that it's just that car.  Lightning McQueen can go as many as 4 times around the entire track, whereas Francesco can't almost make it up the hill even once. I've changed batteries three different times and the last time, when I put the best new batteries in, it actually got worse!  It talks louder and revs louder with newer batteries, but has zero effect on the driving problem.I've called for a replacement and Fisher Price doesn't hassle you because I think they are quite aware of the Francesco issue.  The starting gate is defective in design and you can't get a replacement part - its just designed that way.  After turning the unit over and doing God knows what, I got the gates to work more often now.But when it works as it should?  It's a thriller.  My kids love it.  I can tell it isn't very durable - I've read that if they lean on it, it'll bend, warp or break. But we haven't broken it and they are having fun as long as I hide Francesco, which is an issue when you have 2 kids. So either be prepared to buy an extra car to hold you over in case you have to have them send you a replacement (takes awhile), and make sure the car you buy actually fits - they aren't all standard sized. 2 x 3 x 5 is about the size of the ones that come with it, so watch out for some of the larger ones like Mater.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] My 2.5 year old boy got this as a Christmas gift and absolutely loves it.  He does not spend much time with any one toy, but this one definitely has it.  Granted, I know it is still new, but even his other toys he got for Christmas don't get played with as much.I agree that these cars really do require a lot of shaking.  Since my son is so young, he can't shake them hard, but we've taught him to count to ten when he shakes them, and that seems to be working.  We also realize that he is younger than the recommended age for the toy, but he seems to have grasped the concept very quickly.The toy has helped him with his counting (since we count when shaking).  He is also learning to share and ask for help.The only negatives I have about it is that it is not that stable on our carpet and would probably work better on a thinner carpet or on a solid floor surface.  It does a lot better on our dining room table.  It is quite big, so it takes up a lot of space when it is assembled.  The good thing though is that it does come apart easily, but not so easily that my son can completely take it apart.  Assembly is pretty easy too once you get rid of the instructions because the tracks have numbers underneath so you know which pieces connect.  I just wish that the supports under the ramp portion were a little more stable. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. SHe has not played with it yet but I have. The box was kind of smashed from the store I bought if from (got it for $15 less). I needed to make sure everything worked before I hid it for Christmas. It does Work I was so happy. The 2 cars that come with it require 2AA batteries but work well. I like that you have to shake them to make them work. Gives the kids a little more physical activity and they drove about 10 feet. I could have shaken them more.  I'm sure she will enjoy this toy. Looks like it is selling fast. I bought it now thinking it would be out of stock by Nov. [SEP]",[CLS] Fisher-Price Shake 'n Go!

For those who are not familiar, every year Lego puts out a new advent calendar, and often they actually put out several.This works just like those traditional advent calendars.  The thick cardboard box has a front which opens and then 24 little doors to open inside that. Each door reveals a different small set of Legos wrapped in plastic for the child to put together, one for each day leading up to Christmas.The little lego sets are not all Christmas themed, there are a few like a Christmas tree and some presents, but there is also a policeman and a few days combined together make a police station.  It's nice that even though this a Christmas themed piece, the children can then keep the pieces and add them to their regular collection.My kids love it! Every morning my son can't wait to run downstairs and open a new little door. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My family has been buying Lego Advent Calendar for at least 10 years. Recent editions include mini figures and a few accessories or tools/weapons as a mini-set for one day, it is still fun. My kids especially love the clever modeling using just a few bricks. This is their calendar to remind them that they have to be especially good for Christmas is only days away. The build is easy and kids as young as 4 can build with very little help.Lego in the last few years had released 2 types of advent calendars every year, one is the city and another of a different theme (castle-2008, pirates-2009, kingdoms-2010). This is the first year of Star Wars Advent Calendar. These sets can be found at Lego store for retail price. Once Christmas is over and Lego store is sold out of them, they are hard to find and usually sold by individuals for much more.This City set has 232 pieces and *not* made in China, like the Star Wars Advent Calendar. This is a good gift because it is not constrained to December or 2011. With my first child, we opened our advent calendar in the middle of summer when he was 3 years old, when he was learning to count and learning delayed gratification. We counted the pieces of Lego every day and the number of windows we had opened. And he remembered well that one window a day meant exactly that and stopped whining to open all the windows after the first 3 days.Overall, a good set and highly recommended.

Unless someone looked hard or are particular with that type of thing, they probably wouldn't notice.Mat: It would be a good idea to take it out of the package a few days ahead of time and place something heavy on top of it to let the creases flatten out. The mat is thin plastic, but it protects the floor well. I did have to lift the high chair up a few times to smooth it out because it got all bunched up.

Overall it was just ok for a stocking stuffer type of gift and maybe a gift for a dedicated time for parent/child to sit & create something. But for me it didn't work as solo-play time. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Seeing commercials for the Glow Book, I've been interested in this toy for my 9 year old. Obviously commercials are made to show the absolute best of a product, so I expected it to be much less than what was advertised. I have to admit it's almost as cool as the advertisements. However, the best way to discover if a toy is really worth it is to test it out on more than just a few kids. I went with those who were interested in art. Thus, this is judging based on kids who are already fans of art. Honest opinions from kids:1. It came with pages you could trace for kids who can't draw too well.2. If you make a mistake, it's easy to erase it, but it's hard to make it all clean. You really have to rub well to erase mistakes or it leaves smearing behind. They should have something to erase it better. At least you can use it more than one time.3. It needs more pages. You have plastic pages you draw on and the lights come on to show each page. It makes everything look like it's moving when the lights flash. The pages also aren't very straight.4. I really like to play with the glow book because it is fun. You just have to get used to using it.5. It was just like a movie. I could color and draw it just how I pleased.6. It would be nice if there could be just a little more colors because it shows purple in some of the tracings, but there is no purple. Maybe some black to show outlines, too. It just comes with six colors: tan, pink, yellow, blue, red and green.From an adult's perspective - it definitely has keep the interest going with the kids. It's not a toy that ends up on the shelf - lost and forgotten. However, the price tag is a bit high for something that's so simple. I have seen Amazon have excellent deals on the Glow Book, however, and think if you are patient and give yourself time to find a great deal, you will. Anything less than $20 would be great.  I agree with one of the children that it could use more colors. Especially when dealing with kids interested in art. For younger kids, the small amount of color choices is probably fine.  Glass cleaner takes care of the smudges you'll find after repeated use by kids. After a few mistakes, the drawing takes on a foggy/dusty look - thus making it harder to see the pictures move clearly. Downside is it can't be cleaned until the child is entirely finished. Definitely stick with the manufacturer age recommendation of 6 years and up. This toy is not made well enough to handle rough use from younger kids.

This is one I would probably skip.  It indicates that it is a book, but the pages don't turn like a book.  It is 4 panels of plastic that you pull out to color on and then put them back in to be held by a red binder.  These are clever because your kids work in layers to color a whole picture.  It gives it a  3D feel.  I like that because it makes them think differently, and more creatively.  But with this particular item the panels click, and it is hard to pull the plastic pieces in and out.  Also, if they did four separate drawings, it doesn't allow you to look at them one at a time, with the glow feature, like a book would indicate.  In this case it combines all the panels together like one drawing, again to give you the 3D feel.  The other drawbacks, similar to the other glow products, include the hard to wipe surface.  If you have baby wipes laying around, those work good, but after playing with it for a while, the parent will have to clean it.  This product also requires a specific marker.  It comes with 6 colors.  They last for about a month if your kid is getting the lid back on.  I always double check them.  But I have a beef with Crayola, and it is similar for all their products...it is hard to find refills.  Sometimes they don't make refills (spin art), and others they are hard to find.  These markers have been a little hard to find, and they are kind of pricey.  At one point I had to call Crayola and they did not have them in stores in my area, so they had to send them to me.  That is a little frustrating. Finally, the batteries.  There is no auto shut off feature that I can tell.  And although the batteries seem to last a while, they would last longer if my child remembered to turn it off (which they won't), or if there was an auto shut off.All in all we like this type of product.  I wouldn't chose this type of thing as the only thing your child would get for Christmas.  Additionally, I would mention that we own similar products, the glow dome, and the glow board.  If you are looking for this type of product, go with the glow board over the others.  It is way easier for the kids to manage on their own for some solo play. Although there are only 2 panels, it is easy to pull them in and out, and fun to use for little hands.UPDATE: Someone commented that the auto turn off is after 60 minutes...apparently it exists.  It doesn't always work though, because I have found it at 1 am, and 6 am with the light still on.  Additionally I added a video showing the difference between the three products. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I purchased the Crayola Color Explosion Glow Board about six months ago for my then kindergartener. She loved playing with it and creating some artwork but after a while she got tired of it and was no longer drawn to it. When I saw this item being offered on Vine, I decided to let her try it out as it seemed to offer more than the Glow Board, and it does!There are more possibilities than with the Glow Board. The set includes a battery-powered (3 AA batteries) Glow Book, 6 Glow Markers, and 4 designs for tracing. The designs are removable for coloring and drawing and children can let their imaginations soar with the various possibilities for animation. This is an especially fun toy to be used in the dark as the colors have a glowing effect.This is a great art education/ toy for children ages six and up, and I can see this accompanying us on our road trips and keeping our first grader engaged. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Last year for Christmas we bought our budding artist 6 year old daughter the&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Crayola-Color-Explosion-Glow-Board/dp/B000QUII58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Crayola Color Explosion Glow Board</a>. It was much loved for a few weeks and has been languishing in the closet since then.But with the new Crayola Glow Book it's like Crayola took the idea of the Glow Board and amped it up!For starters as you've likely read it has four boards to color on, not just two, so you can have just about any combination that you want - two boards, three, or four. It's extremely easy to use - simply slide them into the holder after you've finished coloring them and light them up! You can program the lights to go in whatever order you so choose, which makes it even more creative.The book comes with two sheets (pictures on both sides) that your little one can trace, and here's what I love: because the pages are clear plastic, you can put anything behind the plastic so that your child can trace it! This means you can instantly let them draw any of their favorite characters by simply printing out a picture of them and putting it behind the board. Crayola also has some drawing sheets on their website you can download as well.My daughter played with this for HOURS. I swore the batteries were going to die. Then my son wanted a turn and he's 10! And of course once they went to bed I had to try it myself! I liked making a flower that you were able to see grow when you programmed the lights! And what was really fun for me (and them) was leaving them a message on it in the morning. They turned it on Saturday morning when they got up and there was a message from Mom!Overall this is an extremely fun toy and I can see it being something that all of the kids in her classroom are going to want! Crayola definitely improved on their idea and this time they hit a home run! [SEP]"",""[CLS] If you have a budding young artist in your home, you must absolutely get this Crayola Glow Book.  I didn't know at first if my seven and ten year-old kids would take to it; but once they saw the possibilities, they love it.  In fact, they fight over it.  My daughter, who knows I enjoy writing Amazon reviews, insisted I go online and rate this highly.  She's reminded me several times.  She wants everyone to know how wonderful this toy is.The kit comes with six markers and four panels.  The panels have to be removed to color and draw on and then reinserted.  They light up individually, or in sequence to create motion, or they can be programmed in any sequence up to 20 times.  In the dark, the colors glow and it's impressive.When done, just wipe and reuse.  It's not a one shot toy and doesn't require the purchase of any sort of refills.  Kids create to their hearts' content.  I'm thinking of buying this for my niece and nephew for Christmas.  It would make a wonderful gift.  Just remember to buy three AA batteries.*****************A few things to note:* The pages don't open up like a book.  They are clear and meant to be viewed straight on with the drawings shining through the panels.* Only four pictures are included for the children to trace.  When done, it shows a fish swimming towards the viewer.  That's enough to demonstrate the toy's potential to the children.* The lights sleep after 1 hour.

B004Z24R8K,"[CLS] My family has been buying Lego Advent Calendar for at least 10 years. Recent editions include mini figures and a few accessories or tools/weapons as a mini-set for one day, it is still fun. My kids especially love the clever modeling using just a few bricks.Lego in the last few years had released 2 types of advent calendars every year, one is the city and another of a different theme (castle-2008, pirates-2009, kingdoms-2010). This is the first year of Star Wars Advent Calendar and there will probably not be another Star Wars one for another 3-4 years. I'm getting a few sets (at the retail price of $39.99) for my own family and to give away as we have quite a few mini figures fans among our families and friends. This is a good gift because it is not constrained to December or 2011. With my first child, we opened our advent calendar in the middle of summer when he was 3 years old, when he was learning to count and learning delayed gratification. We counted the pieces of Lego every day and the number of windows we had opened. And he remembered well that one window a day meant exactly that and stopped whining to open all the windows after the first 3 days.Overall, a good set and highly recommended. Anything Star Wars is marked up so, yes SW Advent is $5 more expensive than the City version. Also SW Advent has 30+ more pieces than the City one. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I've bought my son a Lego Advent Calendar four years in a row, and he always loves them, so I bought this the first day that I saw it here on Amazon. My 9 year-old will have to wait until the 24 days of Advent for his building fun, but being a huge Lego fan myself I opened the box up at the end and slid the tray out to take a sneak peek at what's inside.Overall, I feel this set is decent, especially if you can get it at its list price of $39.99. There are 8 minifigures - the Lego jackpot from my son's point of view - which include Chewbacca, Nute Gunray, R2Q5, Zev Senesca, a Tie Pilot, a Clone Pilot, a Battle Droid, and Yoda all dressed up in a Santa suit. The rest of the 10-20 piece mini sets build a fleet of tiny Star Wars ships, a handful of droids, weapons and tools rack, and yes, a token Christmas tree.While there is nothing really wrong with this set, I don't think that it's quite as spectacular as the Pirates, Castle, and Kingdoms Lego Advent Calendars released in previous years. Those sets had a lot of exclusive minifigures and unusual accessories, and you could lay everything out together to make a little themed Lego adventure, whereas this set is just a hodge podge of everything Star Wars. If you've got a huge Star Wars fan, I'd still recommend it. But if not, I'd suggest looking at Lego's other 2011 Advent Calendar,&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/LEGO-LEGO-City-Advent-Calendar-7553/dp/B004XONSLC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>LEGO LEGO City Advent Calendar 7553</a>, a cops-and-robbers themed set that starts out at least $5 cheaper and gives you just as many days of building fun.

[SEP]"",""[CLS] Each box has a different Star Wars figure or ship to build, and they all have a nice number of pieces. I bought this as a reward for my son to earn - every time he fills up his chart, he gets to open one of the boxes. It seemed a little extravagant as an advent calendar, but works nicely as a reward treasure box :) [SEP]"",""[CLS] My sons got these as a gift and while my younger child mostly loved the mini-figures, my tween was so excited every day he could hardly contain himself. It was harder for my younger son to follow the limited directions on the open window as well.I know there were some complaints that the vehicles weren't recognizable, but I beg to differ. My son, mom, and I knew exactly what each item was (except one) as soon as it was built. I thought the Millennium Falcon was totally awesome. I could hardly believe they could make it completely recognizable with so few parts.Since there are only numbers on the doors, this gift is reusable every year if you desire. The doors are just thin cardboard so if you plan to display it, or keep it, you will need to take care when opening it. One of our boxes was pretty beat up by Christmas, but my oldest kept his very neat and tidy, so it can be done.I would really only recommend this for a true Star Wars fan of at least 7 or 8. Casual fans probably aren't going to recognize some of the people, or vehicles used from the movies, and cartoon series, and younger fans are probably going to be too impatient with the box and the directions.But for what it is, I was truly impressed, and can't wait to see what theme Lego does next year.

If he's lagging to get out of bed I simply remind him he can open a new one and he pops right up!

B004Z3HV3W,"[CLS] Ticket to Ride is a wonderful family game with many well deserved accolades. But if played often, many wish the game had just a bit more to it.  Ticket to Ride, after all is really just a Rummy variant.  Airlines Europe provides that next step up.  It's a game that still features some luck of the draw, but offers players more opportunities for tactical and strategical considerations.Basically, players are trying to build a better stock portfolio than their opponents.  However, the term stock portfolio should not scare any potential gamers; it is not really a full blown stock market game.  The cards represent shares in ten different companies.  Anyone can collect any color when they come up.  If you want to increase, say, the value of the blue airline, you pay to add a blue route on the map.  You have to be careful though, that action benefits all players holding blue stocks.  You need to try to build and collect stocks in such a way to benefit you the most.  Sometimes it is beneficial to let someone else do the building while you conceal that color in your hand.  There are several subtle layers of strategy in trying to be efficient and benefit from the efforts of other players.  However, being adept at these subtleties is not necessary to enjoy the game.  Most anyone can enjoy this game fifteen minutes after ripping the shrink wrap off the box.  The strategy will come with repeated plays and this is definitely a game that is great to play often.In addition to the design of the game is the outstanding production.  The board is gorgeous and well made an the stock shares are printed on attractive and well made cards.  The plastic airplanes that mark routes on the map are a very nice touch.  The only issue is that the red and orange airplanes are difficult to tell apart.I cannot recommend this game enough. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I've grown to love the Ticket to Ride games over the years, and when I first saw Airlines Europe I thought for sure that it would turn out to be a T2R clone with planes instead of trains.  Boy, was I on the wrong track!  Not that Ticket to Ride is bad (believe me, it's wonderful), but Airlines Europe is a rather unique game that combines a transportation theme with a non-monetary stock market that pays out in Victory Points.  The result is, in my opinion, one of the best games to be released in 2012.  Without getting into the specific game mechanics, here's how it works:  In the early days of aviation, ten airlines of different sizes are vying for the licenses to operate between major cities in Europe.  Players can invest in these ten airlines by securing these licenses, and are rewarded by taking stock certificates (for any of the airlines, not necessarily the one that they bought the license for).  The players may add these stock to their portfolio, or trade it for shares in a larger airline, Air Abacus.  As these airlines expand their territories, markers move up the scoring track.  Three times during the game, a scoring card will be revealed, and each airline will award Victory points (as printed on the scoring track) to the players.  The player with the most stock in an airline will get the most points, the second most stock will get the next highest points, etc.  (Air Abacus has a pre-determined payout of points printed on the board.)  After the third scoring card is revealed and points are awarded, the game ends.  The player with the most points wins.  The game mechanics are simple and straightforward, and should become second nature by the time the first game is done.  Strategically, there's just a bit of a learning curve, though reading the Tactical Tips from the designer is a great help.  But even without those tips, you should get a handle on what works for you and what doesn't pretty quickly.  As for the minor details, the game is beautifully done - from the little airplane markers to the handsomely designed stock certificates and even the storage tray.  The paper money is a bit flimsy, but that's it.  The game scales well from 2 to 5 players - thanks to a well-thought out scoring rule for the 2P game.  It plays in under an hour and a half, but your first couple of games may be a bit longer.  If you like connection games - especially with a transportation-related theme - then you should really check this game out. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This game is by the same designer as Ticket to Ride and is an update on the prior version that he first made called Airlines. The game is beautiful and contains great bits inside with a very durable board and cards. It reminds me of the best elements of Ticket to Ride with the auction mechanic that makes Sid Sackson's Acquire such a great game. This game will be entertaining and is simple, yet strategic that will keep your group guessing who will win as the scoring rounds come up. This printing of the game is great but you do have to pay attention to the colors of the planes as the red and orange planes are hard to tell apart some times. There are some expansions that can be ordered or crafted from boardgamegeek.com that allow you to play with a 6th player or with extra destinations to make the game a little bit more fun. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Airlines Europe: 2-5 Players, Ages 13+, Average Play Time = 60-90 MinutesFirstly, I want to praise the game for having a great tray insert for the pieces.  The pieces themselves were bright and colorful, as were the cards.  My only complaint was that it was hard to tell the difference between the red and orange planes.  The manual did a good job in explaining the rules, but I was forced to re-read it multiple times before everything clicked.  Along that note, this game was a lot to take in at first.  The above doesn't cover all of the nitty-gritty details, which may serve to overwhelm new players.  Our first play session lasted three hours and we were seeking water and Excedrin Migraine by the end of it.  To be fair, we weren't the budding board game connoisseurs that we are today.  I think our biggest hurdle was getting around the fact that players didn't get assigned any particular color.  In games like Ticket to Ride, it's clear as to who is who.  Airlines Europe is more about observing all of the colors and making decisions based on what companies are pulling ahead of the others.There's a boatload of strategy in Airline Europe, mainly due to the fact that not all companies have the same amount of share cards.  This brings company size into the mix.  A company that has eight share cards is small compared to one that has sixteen.  Having five share cards in a company that only has eight ensures that you'll have no competition.  You could, in that example, safely expand that airline without having to worry about someone dropping shares at the last-minute to steal your precious victory points during a scoring round.  By the same token, if you have a significant amount of shares for a larger company in your hand, you could wait and let people spend money to expand it, and then lay your shares down later on which might trump everyone else. You may end up scoring the highest amount of victory points without spending a dime to expand that company.Route cost is also a big part of the game, though it may not be apparent until you see the game in action.  In order to get the company markers up the scoring track, players will need to create routes.  The more expensive the route, the more the company marker moves up the track.  Some companies only have about seven or eight planes, so if you buy a bunch of cheap routes without any real plan, they won't make it far up the scoring track.  The larger airlines (the airlines with more planes) can afford to let this slide a bit.  Before buying a route, I check to see if the marker will hit the next tier on the scoring track, as well as whether or not I have the most share cards of that company.At the time, Carolyn (13, now 15) compared the game to Ticket to Ride, but hated how long it took to play.  Vinnie (10, now 12) voiced similar concerns, but enjoyed the airline theme and was really getting into it despite the recommended age barrier.  I probably got more enjoyment out of the game than the other two, mainly because I really, really enjoy games that revolve around tactical planning and observation.  Chess was the first board game I ever learned how to play and to be successful at it, you'll need to plan ahead and observe the other player.  Airlines Europe is similar in that regard.  You'll need to constantly adapt your strategies based around how the board is playing out and what shares the other players have in their portfolio.  Tiring as it was to spend three hours on this game, I enjoyed every minute of it.  It's worth noting that Vinnie and I recently played the game again and we managed to knock the aforementioned three-hour play time in half.I'd recommend this game to those who don't mind a learning curve and enjoy analyzing things.  This game may not be as complex as Tigris and Euphrates or Agricola, but it's up there.  Once you get the hang of how everything is set up and functions together, play times can be cut to the average play time that the box advertises.  Until then, be sure to set aside some extra time while you're learning the ropes.  Those seeking instant gratification or hate thinking too much about the games they play may not take to Airlines Europe all that well.  With enough patience and the proper parental support, it's my belief that kids a few years under the recommended age can play.  Ultimately, parents will need to make that decision since every child is different in terms of growth.  Overall, it's an excellent game and among my personal favorites. [SEP]"",""[CLS] If you like ticket to ride but want something with a bit more strategy, then Airlines is a must for any collection.  It can be picked up and taught quickly and I have played it with young kids and elderly adults, and all involved enjoyed it.  High quality production adds to the over theme of the game. [SEP]",[CLS] The age of passenger aviation has begun. Courageous entrepreneurs establish the first airlines and compete for the few available licenses in the European air space. The rapidly growing market and the chance for high gains attract high-powered investors. But only the ones that use their influence skillfully and their cash wisely will turn their investments into the most profitable airlines.

Most children's games are mind numbingly dull, but this one isn't.  There are cute little descriptions that help create a 'mood' and enough differences in each game that keep everyone interested.  I highly recommend this! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Gubs hits a lot of sweet spots for a quick-play card game.  There is a learning curve of about 2 games until you figure out how all the cards interact with each other, but after that it's a nice filler, or good for families/kids who want something more challenging than Uno and rummy, but less involved than Munchkin or Citadels.  The tin (love those Gamewright tins) says age 10+, but my son is 8 and has no problem with it.  If your kids read fairly well and have played other multiple-role games like chess or Carcassonne, they will have fun with it, especially if they are fans of the Spiderwick books.I play a lot of strategy board and card games, so I'm probably harder to please than a lot of people when it comes to games like Gubs.  I definitely don't like the event card that makes you completely wipe out all of your cards in play (especially late in the game), because it negates any strategy you've employed with one blind luck of the draw, and there is only one card that can counter it.  Fortunately, the game paces quickly, so you won't have to wait long to try again.  My family played 3 games on an hour ferry ride. Gubs definitely hits its target audience of kids or families who are ready for a light thematic card game with some strategy and a little luck.

We tend to enjoy strategy games (even Rat-a-Tat-Cat and Sleeping Queens are more fun to us than this game).  I guess this one just was not our thing.  Maybe the premise was just a little too far-fetched for us.  I don't recommend it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is a simple, easy, quick little game we enjoy playing on road trips and during camping trips.

In fact, he made me play 3 games in a row and he beat me 2 out of 3.  The graphics are great and really appeal to him.  Also, I (retired teacher) like the fact that he has to read and use some critical thinking skills to play.  He is 9 and picked up the game rather quickly.  However, I feel this might be difficult for many under this age, like his 6-year old sister.  Some of the directions were not totally clear, but I have found this to be the case with several Gamewright games we have.

She took the doll in her arms and hugged and kissed her and then took the puppie and hugged it and said lollies baby puppie. It is made of plastic but this makes it to be able to be cleaned easier and this is a big thing with my daughter. Every little girl will love this doll :) [SEP]"",""[CLS] The Lalaloopsy dolls are just magnificent.  They are so reminiscent of the old Rag Dolls that I used to play with as a young girl.  They are plastic, but don't let that fool you into thinking they aren't lovable.  They are precious.  Lalaloopsy Suzette La Sweet is so perfect with her pink dress and large button eyes and matching pup.  She  just brings a smile to my face!  I have purchased a few of these for Christmas presents for my 4 year old niece as well as for my 6 year old niece.  Both girls love these cuties.  They are very durable, have clothes and accessories that can be purchased for each doll as well as Lalaloopsy chapter books and coloring books.  They are also incredible to have for a daycare setup since they are SO EASY to lysol clean and disinfect.  I think they are perfect for little imaginations...almost a flashback to the 50's when all the girls loved their little dolls with button eyes and single line smiles! [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 4-year-old wanted this Lalaloopsy above all others, and when she got it, she carried it around all day, including to the movies. Considering the shoes kept falling off, I warned my daughter to be very careful not to lose the shoes. A minute after we left the theatre, I looked down and-- sure enough-- no shoes. We had to go back into the theatre and crawl around and (luckily) find the shoes.Then we went to the arcade, where, yet again, more crawling around ensued. I stuck the shoes in my pocketbook and have refused to give them back. I'm going to glue them to her feet, despite my daughter's objections, because they were already lost twice in about 6 hours. It's not cool that there was no real testing on this doll to find out that this occurs-- or if there was any testing, that the manufacturer didn't care. The dolls seem to be made with a lot of care otherwise.Aside from that: This doll's head is a little heavier than the other two we have, so it's more like a little bowling ball on top of the body. She's beautiful in person, so if you like the photo, you'll also like the doll itself. All the Lalaloopsy dolls are hard plastic, so I don't advise them for toddlers-- too heavy and not squeezable. But for 4+, it's a matter of taste. My daughter loves these dolls, and Suzette is her favorite so far.All that said, I think it's a little lame to have a limited edition child's doll that's more expensive than the others, when the only real upgrade is the pearlized paint on the hair. [SEP]"",""[CLS] It took a while for my daughter to get past the creepy button eyes and the hard plastic body of the doll.  Her friends were much more enthralled with the doll than she was at first. Once she got past her Coraline fears, the doll quickly became her favorite. The thick plastic body of the doll guarantees a long play life but a not so cuddly night sleep if your child likes to sleep with favorite toys. You can't do much with the doll except change it's clothes and shoes, but that doesn't seem a hindrance to my daughter's enjoyment of it. The only downside that I felt this doll possessed is the poorly fitting and easily lost shoes and socks. Once you remove the shoes, they are forever falling off. One shoe went MIA somewhere between our home and various stops along the way. Replacement clothing and shoes seem a little pricey, but then so was this doll. Granted, Amazon offered the doll for less than retail stores and the no tax and free shipping with Prime are a bonus... But the price tag is still just a wee bit steep unless Amazon runs another special on it. The hard plastic pet cracks me up. It reminds me of a baby bath toy - cute and safe to chew on without any tiny parts. My daughter's comment was, Really? What are you suppose to do with that? As you can guess by her comment, the poodle mostly just sits on the shelf. I couldn't convince her to just use it as a bath toy. Apparently, bath toys are for younger kids - according to my daughter. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I got this doll for my 4yr old daughter. She got one when she was 3 and loved it, she carried it around everywhere. I was surprised since these dolls are hard plastic and not really soft and cuddly, but kids do seem to like them. They are really adorable. Suzette La Sweet comes with an adorable little puppy as her pet, it is all plastic.  She has platinum blonde hair almost white but has a shine to it, black button eyes, a little black dot by her eye(resembling a beauty mark) and rosy pink cheeks. Her dress is really cute different shades of pink with plaid and floral print and 3 little sky blue bows at the neck. Her shoes are sky blue with pink bows and are removable, and she has white knee high socks with lace trim. For anyone who collects lalaloopsy she would be a great addition to their collection. For anyone not familiar with these dolls, The head, hair and body are all plastic, their head makes them kind of top heavy and while their arms and legs are moveable they don't stay in a fixed position. They can be placed in a sitting position if they are propped up against something. They do seem to be quite popular among little ones. I would say ages ranging between 3 to 7. Although when my 3yr old recieved hers as a gift last year my 9yr & 11yr old thought it was adorable and were both playing with it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Little girls seem to love everything about Lalaloopsies. We have many of the smaller minifigures, and my daughter was thrilled to find out Suzette was joining the gang. She's one of the more girly dolls (in my opinion), and I think she'd make a perfect gift for a little girl who loves tea parties and playing princess. She's easy to clean, and even though her head is hard, she's floppy just like a rag doll. Her toy poodle is a perfect playmate and my daughter's had loads of fun inventing adventures for both of them. Her pink, white and light blue outfit is adorable and will bring a smile to any little girl's face. Overall, I think this doll would make a cute present for a little girl who loves dolls, especially as it is sturdy enough to take a lot of loving and play time. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Suzette La Sweet is my 5 year-old's third Lalaloopsy doll, and she really loves her! For those unfamiliar with the product line, Lalaloopsies are large, hard-plastic dolls made to resemble old-fashioned rag dolls. On the positive side, being all plastic, they are easy to clean, easy to dress, hard to break, and never get tangled hair. On the negative side, they are quite top-heavy and not at all cuddly. My daughter doesn't seem to mind that, though, as she still takes her favorite one to bed with her every night.Suzette La Sweet has glittery white hair with pink bows. She comes wearing high-quality, beautifully made clothes, as do all of the Laloopsies, including a poofy french-maid style dress, lace-topped stockings, and the cutest little blue shoes. The best part about her, in my opinion, is that her shoes and stockings do a pretty good job of staying on... some of our other Lalaloopsy dolls have shoes and socks that constantly fall off, and that's no fun for anyone! Suzette is definitely one of the most frilly, princess-like dolls in this year's Laloopsy collection and I think a good choice for anyone with a girly-girl like mine.

B00545ML1W,"[CLS] The K'Nex Renewable Energy is part of their education directed sets. The set comes with solar components tat allow you to make a solar car, a shuttle ride, a crank man, a hydroelectric generator, a windmill, etc.Pros: The set comes with the high-quality K'nex pieces (583), a small 22 page manual if you just want to build the solar powered models, and a teacher's guide on a disk if you are using this set for instructional purposes either in a science class or with a science club.The teacher's guide is 169 pages (though the last few pages are largely empty). What are very useful are the lesson plans with student response sheets (and thankfully teacher answer sheets). There is also a glossary of terms that you can give to the students near the back of the guide.  While you may want to cut and past the student sheets to give them more room to write, the strands of instruction, and questions asked all would easily meet the new common core rigor expected.As for student interest it is HIGH! It took a few tries to get the solar car right but boy, did they learn a lot going through the process and they didn't need prompting to go back to the manual (and they asked to read the teacher's manual too to see if that could help!).The set is for grades 5-9 but if you have high performing fourth graders and you don't mind guiding them they can follow along (and may even get ahead) of you.Neutral:  The pieces fit nicely when unassembled but you'll need a larger tub to hold them if you are in the midst of construction of a model.Cons: The pieces come packaged in plastic, it would be really great if an educational set of building blocks about renewable energy came in bags that could be resealed and used again, but they don't - so have some quart and gallon sized bags ready for putting the pieces away when you are done, if you want to keep them organized.This is not inexpensive but if you are using it with a class, a club, or your own budding scientist it really delivers.  So if you spread the cost out over the hours of enjoyment and exploration, it becomes a lot more reasonable. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My 12 year old son is definitely a techie lover, and buying gifts for him is getting more and more difficult as he gets older. I'm constantly searching for something that I can get him that he can actually play with, or use, that's not a video game or something related to his computer.The K'NEX energy set hit the spot! This set was absolutely perfect to allow him to actually do something that he's interested in that's not a video game. Regular K'NEX sets have never been that interesting to him, but the fact that you can actually make moving parts and can learn about renewable energy as well.I also love the fact that there are enough parts that my daughter and I could play around with them while my son was working on his set at the same time! This is definitely a very unique set and is ideal for any techie lover! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Okay, I got this thinking the grandchildren would enjoy building with it. But football and other school activities interfered with their visits and - poor me - I had to play - I mean research - this set all by myself. No interference. No interruptions. No temper tantrums because a part can't be instantaneously found or doesn't fit super-easily. Just me, my slightly arthritic fingers, 583 parts and 3 picture-filled instruction booklets. I had a lot of fun putting some the possible models together. My only other experience with K'nex is with a couple of their roller coaster sets which were difficult for me because the parts are smaller than those in the regular sets. The parts in this were amply sized and easy for my ancient fingers to work with. Kids will not have a problem. Designs are provided for a total of nine (9) Solar Powered, Wind Powered or Water Powered models. The set is designed for classroom use with small groups building several models simultaneously. Instructions are presented as break-away drawings. I thought they were very clear IF you took the time to look through them before starting to build. I would caution parents to suggest their children do precisely that before starting to build their models. (Nice thought, eh? Just imagine a nine or ten year old that patient.) I had no trouble following the instructions. The parts fit together well. Three motors, a capacitor and solar panel are provided. The models lend themselves to use as examples of how wind, water and light can be used to power devices. Overall, this is an excellent construction toy, well-designed and certainly capable of providing both fun and increasing knowledge.Jerry [SEP]"",""[CLS] My husband and I are classroom teachers, but I got this set for my son to work with. He loves to build things and is extremely interested in science. What a cool set to have around that combines science concepts with concrete/hands-on building about renewable energy sources and machines. My son is 10 years old (4th grade) and was fully capable of building the mini-structures on his own with no guidance. He was most excited to build the solar car and got the car to move.  He also learned about a capacitor and it's function through this set.  The second structure he was most interested in building was the water wheel.  He was successful in building these sets on his own.His only complaint was that there were no written instructions for him to follow when building the mini-structures. He said the instructions were picture only and he would have liked to have had written instructions to go along with each building project. There are teacher lesson plans to go with each renewable energy mini-structure.My husband will be taking this set to his after school program to work with students. I will be updating my review after he has used it with a group of students. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This set is packaged in a nice plastic bin to hold the hundreds of pieces used to make the models. Although there is only one solar panel, there are 3 motors, so you can build 3 of the same models simultaneously, as in a classroom setting. I was able to build the 'crank man' model in less than an hour. It takes a while to figure out how some of the pieces fit together, but it is not beyond anyone familiar with Legos. Once finished, and placed in the sun (or near a 100-watt incandescent bulb), it shifts into action, powered by solar energy. A capacitor is also provided to demonstrate how the energy can be 'reserved' for later use.There are also cleverly designed models for hydro (water power) and wind power.The workbook/manual has excellent diagrams of each model and I had no problem assembling the models, however, there were a few times when I had to look at the the diagrams very carefully. Once the model is assembled, you have a very solid model that is fun to play with, and can be very educational.Included with this set is a CD that has a pdf document that serves as a teacher's guide. It gives a description of each model, and offers science theory and questions to test the 'students' about the models. It is well-designed and a good addition to this kit.As far as ages go, I would not expect my intelligent 5-year old grandson to put a model together by himself. But with some adult direction, he could help to assemble some of the models. I am looking forward to him helping me with some of the other models. I would think that a 3rd or 4th grader would be able to build some of these models with some guidance.Each part is color-coded and easy to pick out from the several plastic bags that contain the various parts. Some parts fit together snugly and need a bit of force to get them in place. The plastic is smoothly finished and seems to be high quality. The parts bin doubles as a water reservoir for the hydro-powered models. Nice design.I just want to mention that as a child in the 1950's and 60's, my favorite toys were Erector Sets, and Kenner Hydrodynamics, and Bridge and Girder sets. Although these were educational in nature, they provided me many hours of creative enjoyment. These Knex kits are similar in nature, but geared towards the classroom. As a parent, I would not rule out these sets as gifts (albeit expensive gifts) for young children. I would think they could serve as a basis for science projects, or just look cool on the shelf in their bedroom. A good alternative would be any of the other K'nex sets that are much less expensive and could provide similar educational and fun experiences.

There are special items to collect and places to conquer, and the Underground world presents additional challenges. Overall, I give it two thumbs up! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I thoroughly enjoyed the original Smallworld and own all of the expansions, so admittedly my review of SW Underground is influenced by my familiarity with the theme and mechanics (which are found in this game as well), but here's what I like about Underground on its own merit:1. The monster tokens.  Defeating monsters gives you control of a special artifact or adds a special bonus feature to that territory.  Most of these are essentially the equivalent of having a second special power, so controlling them (even when your race is in decline) adds a new level of strategy not found in the original game.2. The river.  Any race can cross it, which can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on your race/power combo, but it's different from the original game which only allowed a seafaring race to control the lake, forcing everyone else to go around it.3. New races and powers.  Most of these suit the underground theme well, and several abilities are designed to take advantage of the new board features.And now for the minimal gripes, which are basically the same as with the original Smallworld:1. The occasional random super/useless-combo.  I love the variety of races and special powers, but sometimes a player just ends up getting one right after the other that are just really tough to beat, or completely useless based on the current board situation.  No, it's not always balanced.  For me, this doesn't take much out of the fun of playing, but for others it does.2. Having to check the reference sheet every couple of minutes due to the sheer variety of races and powers.  If you've already played Smallworld, then most of them will make sense right away.  Otherwise you'll probably have to play a few games to figure them all out.I personally don't like trying to combine both the original and SW Underground.  It's not very fluid, and not all of the races and powers translate from one game to the other, so I recommend playing this one on its own.  That said, even if you don't have the original, if you like conquest games like Risk, but would rather play a more lighthearted game in under 2 hours, this is a great choice.  Typical Days of Wonder quality components, humorous fantasy artwork, and gameplay that's bound to generate some great one-liners around the table.

Cookie Monster is already getting dragged around the house! It's great quality and worth the purchase! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Is it just me, or did this version of Cookie Monster go on a diet?  I bought this for my son, who loves Cookie Monster in all his cookie eating glory, as one of his upcoming Christmas presents. And despite the comparatively runway svelte style of Gund's interpretation of his Cookieness, I'm pretty sure my son will be able to recognize him.So, the fur is soft...not super soft, but still soft enough I think my little guy will like that. On mine, there is no issue with fur shedding or coming out when pulled. The eyes seem to be well attached, and I like that too because my son is a chewer, and despite his fondness of Cookie Monster, I'm pretty sure he's going to be chewing on the eyes.Where I am taking the star off is there is an area on the toy's backside where there's gaping in the stitching of nearly half an inch.  This is shown in picture two.  If you will notice the stitch that is stretched out (this is actually what caught my attention about this area, and is noted with an arrow) that is actually a loose stitch, and right to the left of it (I've bracketed the area) there is a gap you can stick your finger in with no stitching whatsoever.  So, basically, it's a hole, that stuffing, etc.  can come out of.  I'm not pulling any out or making the hole bigger to illustrate the point because then I'd have a bigger area to stitch up, and I'm crazy busy and don't want to be repairing more then I need to.As it is, the hole isn't too big, it will take me a few minutes to fix, but if I have to make any sort of repairs to a brand new item, I feel like I can't give it 5 stars.  I haven't seen any other issues with the seems, however, having an issue right of the bat might not bode well.

Sometimes it's played like regular Charades, sometimes whoever guesses gets the next turn, sometimes we do teams without being able to consult with each other before we act the word(s) out, etc.  It's educational as well as fun because of the many brain connections that have to be used in order to act out the word(s).  It also encourages working together and good sportsmanship.  It's fast-paced and the laughter is priceless! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Reverse Charades Junior is a great charades game for families.Last year we reviewed Reverse Charades and Rollick - a couple games that employed the same new charades game mechanic. Both of these games had a twist on the typical charades game play of 1 person acting out while their teammates tried to guess the word or phrase. Instead, as the name implies, Reverse Charades and Rollick challenges the group to act out while only 1 person guesses.Who knew that such a simple twist on charades could lead to so much fun.However, even though they're a lot of fun to play, we found that they aren't as fun for children. A lot of the reason why they aren't as fun for family play with kids is because many of the words are unfamiliar to a younger crowd.But then along came Reverse Charades Junior and it all changed.Now we can have a great time playing this fun charades game with our whole family.Reverse Charades Junior is full of words that kids can enjoy acting out as well.

That's it - that's the simple concept behind Reverse Charades, a new game that's just come out from Retroplay and Gryphon Games. And let me tell you, it works. This small twist to the classic game somehow successfully turns a good game into an even better one!Charades is funnier with more people acting at once. A good actor can be funny to watch, for example imagine someone acting out vacuum, doggie paddle, changing a diaper, pillow fight, or mouse trap. But these can become twice as funny when you have a group combining to act them out. For example, with changing a diaper you can have one team member being the baby, while another one pretends to change the diaper. Also imagine having four people at once acting doggie paddle or ants in your pants - it becomes even more hilarious than just having one person act it out!But there are more advantages: Because multiple people are acting out words at once and together, the words are usually easier to guess.  It's also more friendly for the self-conscious person in the crowd.  The good thing with Reverse Charades is that it takes away the pressure of being a solo performer - instead of just one person acting, most of the team is! This helps people loosen up and lose their inhibitions, and also takes away the focus from one individual who may have social inhibitions.The Junior Edition has 360 word cards with words on both sides for a total of 720 words.  It's practically the same as the original edition of the game, except that about half of the more difficult words have been replaced to make them more suitable for children as young as 6, so it's a better choice for families. Aside from that, these two editions are identical, so both are good choices.So are Reverse Charades or Reverse Charades Junior Edition games for you? If you enjoy party games, this is an outstanding one of its type. It's true that the success of games like this often depend a lot on the group you're with. But the simple rule change to the traditional Charades is a good one, which makes the game more accessible, more fun, and also makes it more likely to succeed, even with less extrovert personalities.

Well, remove all the small pieces from the Playmobil set, and what do you get, a very functional, versatile car, little Playmobil people can sit in, be transported etc.This is one of many she now has, and she loves to drive them to the castle of fort to pick up the injured animals. Combined with the fire truck, this is a great make believe play set. The detail is also very well worked out.1) The top of the roof comes off for easier access to the inside.2) The front cockpit comes off to put the driver in3) The ambulance word spelled on the front is mirrored. That detailed surprised me, since it is accurate, but I would not have expected that level of accuracy for such a cheap toy.4) The rubber tires are soft, so they won't scratch wooden floors.Overall the best Ambulance value I could find.

Vest and shirt have tough Velcro closures. Vest is not connected to shirt. They are easily removable as well.Nein:-Purse lid/flap fell off immediately, and the inner chamber is so small that the included laptop cannot fit in there, nor can Frankie's stray pinkie finger.-Silver belt is tied on, and Gott help you if it comes off.

Her clothes and accessories are very cute with the exception of the collar and cuffs. All these consist of are cut pieces of fabric with no finished edge.

B005AHICA8,"[CLS] My son and I had a really fun time building the first setup as described in the instructions.It was fun overall.But I'm here to tell you its super finicky.  One important take away for my son was that if you change the position of a slide near the top, you probably have to change the position of every other object all the way down.Also the instructions don't show much of a drop in some of their set-ups but we had to have a 4 inch straight down drop to get the pig to launch.Sometimes the ball would jump the track for no reason, and then work properly when we started over.  Its very inconsistent.Some of the objects, like the broom, require too much tweaking to get it to work right.  There is also a boot object where the ball drops in the boot and then a hand on the other end of the stick tilts a bucket.These objects look really cool but there is so much play or looseness in them that they don't work as intended even when they are set up right.Sometimes the velcro parts start to peel off the board, and if you don't notice then your marble will of course drop to the table with an annoyingly loud sound.  You probably wouldn't want to do this on a glass table, those metal balls are pretty heavy!I think the manufacturer would have been better off to make a grid with holes, and have us put the objects in the grid.  If it were designed right, it would solve a lot of problems and be much less finicky.Bottom line: if you and your child are patient enough to tweak your design for 30 minutes, then you will enjoy it.  But if you want to just slap some objects on the board and make it work in 5 minutes then you'll probably be pretty frustrated.Since we had fun I would put it at 4 stars.  But there were definitely times I just wanted to say lets do something else now and stop working on it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This is fun for kids.  As with all plastic parts I don't know how long this will hold up, but my kids (6 &8) play with it a lot. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This toy is terrific for the educational value: the basics of gravity, magnetics, and engineering.My daughter is eight years old (this toy is for ages 8+), and immediately set to work building with it. She had no problems doing it herself, she is not a use-the-manual kind of kid, and had fun trying to get the ball from Point A to Point B.The kit includes two black panels with an orange plastic frame for holding them upright. There is an entire bag of building materials: chutes, bumps, a toilet and even a flying pig. The kit includes brackets for holding on the chutes and paths, which have heavy-duty velcro on the back. All of the pieces stayed firmly on the backing, with the exception of the flying pig, which tended to droop a little. The flying pig is also a projectile, so you will want to keep a firm eye on your little scientist getting carried away with launching it at other kids and pets.There is a magnet wand and the balls are heavy metal, so you can use the magnetic wand to demonstrate magnetism.This toy is very much like a project you would see in a hands-on science museum. It is a great idea for a kinesthetic learner, a child who likes to learn by doing.In future versions, I would love to see a storage pouch or case, to keep the pieces all in one place. [SEP]"",""[CLS] This toy has many mixed reviews which I read prior to using this toy. I personally couldn't decide between three or four stars, but settled on three when I thought I would likely not recommend it to friends.This toy is for my 6 year old son.My impression is:Pros:- Plenty of parts to make many different contraptions- velcro seems to hold fairly wellCons:- Velcro only lasts so long and I imagine these pieces will not hold tight to the wall over time. Other reviewers mention the fabric separating from the board, which we haven't experience, but we have been careful removing the pieces. The children are less patient and I imagine they will damage the velcro more readily with normal play.- The parts seemed cheap. OK, it is a plastic toy. But some plastics (Lego, K'nex) have a quality to them, this is more akin to a happy meal toy.- Marbles are loud on a hard surface. There is a lot of trial and error and when there is an error it can be loud . So best on a soft surface.- Playing on a carpet can make the game tilt one way or the other, making the marbles fall off. So a too-soft surface isn't ideal either.Neutral:- The contraptions are not trivial to make. It takes much patience and trial and error. This can be a great learning experience for those who are patient, but could be frustrating to those using apps like Amazing Alex and who expect everything to work perfectly and repeatably. This is the real world, so nothing happens exactly the same way twice. So this is more for the patient, curious, and thoughtfull.

I found this Playable ART Ball doing a general search for toys for kids with autism, so I cannot claim thinking of it on my own. My 5-year-old daughter, who is not on the autism spectrum, also loves it as do I. So, it's really a toy for everyone.The balls are connected to each other in some way that I cannot really describe, but they move in pairs and can rotate. You can make a variety of shapes with them and move them around. They are all connected to each other, which I think is clear from the product pictures. The whole thing is just one piece that can be manipulated. While I have not been able to make the cube or some of the stacks shown in the product picture, I do have fun manipulating it.The pieces move around and give them sensory value for lack of a better word. They are wooden but feel smooth, and the piece is easy to manipulate yet will stay in place. That is what makes this a great toy for those on the autism spectrum. I find it relaxing just to sort of mess with them and see what patterns I can make--sort of a stress reliever, I suppose.The paint does wear off after a while, but that is to be expected. After over a year of ownership and being in the hands of many kids, you can see where the paint is wearing then. Still plenty of color. [SEP]","[CLS] Limitless creativity in the palm of your hand.

B005C3FXAM,"[CLS] It's pretty difficult to put something together when there are several languages for the instructions but English isn't one of them. We had to look at the book of different activities you can do with the toy to figure out where some of the parts went or use the box.  I didn't even know what some of the parts were but the book helped. Same with the stickers; no instructions.  I had to look at the box to see where the stickers went. You also need 8 AAA batteries; 2 for each headlight (lights turn on), 2 for the steering wheel for the horn to honk and 2 for the ignition (makes starting sounds).  However, if I hadn't of read the description and reviews I wouldn't have known where to look to put batteries as there are no instructions telling you you need batteries or where they go.  Also, the key isn't a regular looking key.  There is a tiny knob on the end that you have to put in the tiny hole for the ignition.  I don't think a child could figure that out. I haven't been able to get the headlights to work so I may have to send the toy back. Also there is a button near the ignition. I'm not sure what that is for. You push it in but it doesn't do anything. Apparently there are car jacks on the back of the toy which I found by accident. They are yellow rods that go up and down and jack the toy up off the ground in the back. Again, didn't know as there are no instructions in English!  The hot wheel type track is very cheap super thin plastic. Not your hot wheel brand quality of track. The track has two prongs that you stick into slots on the back of the toy. I found that out by accident too. The steering wheel comes off really easy.  There's nothing to lock it in place. The pipes sticking out of the engine make it hard to close the hood down.  You have to move them to get the hood down. I think the toy is a cute concept but way overpriced and has some issues with design. There are several things you can take apart and screw back on. I read some of the reviews about the headlights so I will try their suggestions. I'll be sending it back if I can't get everything to work on it.Update: After putting another set of batteries in the headlights and playing with them I have found that you push in on the headlight itself  as it is actually a button to turn on the light.  To shut the headlight off you hit the red button next to the head light.  Instructions in English would really be beneficial. Without them is a trial and error. [SEP]"",""[CLS] It's alright. That's about it. And I'm being generous because my kid got it as a gift that I didn't pay for. If I had paid retail price for this I'd be a lot less satisfied.First off it says for 3 and up. No way. My 6 year old and I had a good time putting it together. But it's WAY to complex for a 3 year old.It's kinda fun. But it won't teach you anything about how a car works. The joy is in bolting the pieces together and seeing the car take shape.But it's not without it's problems.The fenders don't bolt on properly. There are 3 bolts on each side. 1 of them doesn't line up with the holes on the car frame. It's a good inch out of line. That's not an installation error. That's a massive design flaw.The headlights are a stupid design, to say the least. You push the headlight in to turn it on/off. But there is a red button next to the headlight that disables it completely until it's removed from the socket and a button on the side of the battery casing it reset. I ended up taping those reset buttons down so the red button doesn't do anything. That's just insane that it would do that. There is absolutely no reason for it.The ignition switch is junk. It has another complex reset system that doesn't work. The key makes the engine starting sound about once every ten times it's turned. You may as well just save the batteries and leave them out of the ignition key. It's an insanely overly complex design for 1 purpose whatsoever.The orange header pipes just sit there. Nothing holds them in. It took us all of an hour to lose one. And opening the hood knocks them off every single time.My biggest complaint is the tools that come with it. It comes with 2 spark plug wrenches...for the 4 spark plugs. Why do you need 2 wrenches for 4 plugs? But it's got 25 larger bolts that hold all the other components together and no screwdriver that fits them. There's a wrench that's awkward to use. Thankfully I have a plastic screwdriver from another tool toy that fit and made this toy usable.As far as the Matchbox cars ramp...why? It's an 18 inch ramp that goes straight down. It's so simple it's boring. What's the point? It has nothing to do with the overall toy. It's like an add on element that was poorly thought out.All in all, it's not worth the money.

B005COHOM6,"[CLS] Game is enjoyable. Unlimited replay value. It's not the best ou there, but definitely not the worst either. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I looked at the card that told me where I could play.  Since I already had settlements next to flowered hexes, that's where I had to go.  But I did have an oasis so I could place another settlement on any desert hex.  Ah!  Those flowers are by those mountains.  For each settlement next to mountains I'd get a point.  Three there... and there was one more open desert tile surrounding that city.  That scored me three points, as many points as the three flowered hexes at the foot of the mountain.  While the title didn't really exist, this would fortify my self proclaimed title of the mountain king- I was really going to pull a lot of points being next to so many mountain hexes.Before game playThis aesthetically pleasing game board is actually made of four interconnecting game boards.  There are more in the box to choose from making the map of hexes different each time you play.  This is also nice for those who maybe wanted to add additional players to the game, though they'd need to have 40 or so settlement pieces, there is an expansion that adds a red team for a fifth player.There are several goal cards that you can choose from when playing.  Hexes near water may score points for fisherman.  Miners might score points for hexes adjacent to mountains, travelers might score more points for have a settlement on each row of the board.  Hermits might score for having unconnected settlements, etc.  There are more of these than there are boards so the goals, or ways to score points vary from game to game.Each board you use has it's own feature on one of it's hexes that if you build next two before other players, you get the special power that lets you place a fourth settlement according to the powers rule or you get to move aa existing settlement.The box boasts that there are a gazillion (my word) ways to play the game.  Certainly true.Game playOn your turn you've got one card that matches a color of hexes that appear on the board, you get to place three settlements.  They need to be touching unless there aren't hexes of that color adjacent to any settlements you've previously placed on the board.  The game end is signaled when one player runs out of settlements.  Everyone gets their last ups where that's applicable and you score your points.  Pretty simple.I hate to tell you what to do but...You will always get three points for building on hexes surrounding city hexes.  This is the best way to score points.  Just saying: don't get slaughtered by people who can do math.ThemeThe maker of this game also made the deck building game of dominion.  The theme is pretty weak in both games, but that doesn't mean that an abstract games can't be fun.BalanceVery well Balanced.  But there is drawing of cards, sometimes you don't get what you want, the only way to mitigate that is to get some secret power that can help some, but the luck of the draw may even keep you from that.  I've heard complaints from players after game-end about not ever getting a forest or plains card.  Sorry.  Ok, maybe I've been one to complain.InteractionLow.  This game could easily be played very quietly, depending on the crowd you have at the table.  Murmuring of being cut off from hexes around a city or a mountain range or a river, or congrats on a good move are the sorts of comments to expect.Learning CurveVery low, if you could follow me above, you should be good.  It's a good way to introduce people to multiple paths to victory and since players must play on one color of hex, the analysis paralysis is pretty limited.DowntimeMedium.  You do have to wait your turn, and the moves of others can affect what you want to do so reconsidering easily happens despite the best laid plans.  But no one can have runaway long turns like you can have in dominion, so that's nice.Whats not to Like?The main complaint I've heard is that you only get to play on one terrain type, and that of your single card.  This can be mitigated with house rules.  Just have a hand of two cards.  This helps, but still has the same draw back of never getting the cards you wanted.  Another house rule to mix things up I like is to have a secret score card.  You are the only one who scores that way, and everyone else has their own too.Collateral EndorsementsNo one I have introduced this game to has said, well I wouldn't be sad if that game was never brought again.  That was said of Camel Up.  Some have bought the game after playing it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Kingdom Builder is easily the most played game in our household over the last few months.

After the immense success of his 2008 hit Dominion (winner of the 2009 Spiel des Jahres award), designer Donald X. Vaccarino has come up with yet another clever design that features randomized elements to ensure strong replayability and changing gameplay from game to game, combined with a short play time and simple rules that appeal readily to gamers and non-gamers alike.Gameplay is very straight forward - setup a configuration of four starting boards chosen randomly, and select three of the ten kingdom builder cards, which will determine the point-scoring objectives to win the game.  In turns, players will then play a card and place three settlements on the board in the corresponding terrain type (grass, flower fields, forest, canyon, desert, mountains, or water), trying to place them in a way that will earn the most points at the game end, as awarded by the three starting kingdom builder cards.  If you have settlements beside special location hexes, these will give you the ability to perform special actions to help your cause.The simplicity of the rules, combined with the short play time, attractive components, and perfect blend of luck/strategy devoid of viciousness makes Kingdom Builder ideally suited to introduce to non-gamers, friends and family.  There is some theme, but it is largely window dressing that plays a serving role to the puzzle-like tactical game-play, and this is where the real fun lies.  There is some luck as a result of the card-draw, but the fact that you're restricted to building on the matching terrain type and adjacent to existing settlements doesn't mean that the game lacks meaningful decisions. Rather, this prevents the game bogging down with analysis paralysis,  and keep it moving briskly, while requiring players to be flexible, and keep their options open.  Your initial placement is particularly important, and the location tiles also generate a lot of clever tactical possibilities; much of the game revolves around acquiring and exploiting these to strong-arm your way toward the kingdom builder card goals. Veteran players will argue that there's more strategy than meets the eye, especially with repeated play.Kingdom Builder is also remarkably replayable.  One of the best things about it are the modular boards, each with their unique location tiles, and the random selection of kingdom builder cards. This means that your objections will be different each game, as will the means you have available to accomplish them. It makes each game a fresh experience and a unique puzzle to solve, and folks who do enjoy the gameplay will find themselves coming back for more and more.Kingdom Builder doesn't make a contribution to modern games in the same way as Vaccarino's previous effort Dominion did with its influential deck-building mechanic. Yet it is still a clever and excellent game that offers more that meets the eye. You can get hosed by the luck of the draw from time to time, but each game offers you a fresh challenge of goals, with a fresh combination of means to get there, and that will keep most players coming back for more every time again. While it won't satisfy gamers who are easily frustrated by some luck or who are looking for deeper strategy, it is the kind of game that will be successful with almost everyone else, and richly deserves the praise and generally positive reception it has received until now.

It is highly addictive, easy to learn (in about 5-10 minutes), and plays in an hour or less even with four players. Overall production value of the box, boards, and cards is extremely durable, pretty, and high.Each player begins with 40 wooden settlements (shaped like houses) that come in black, orange, blue, or natural wood. your goal is to complete all three victory conditions to the best of your ability by strategically placing your settlements to maximize your points while blocking your opponents. The game comes with ten victory condition cards of which you can pick or randomly choose three to use in each game. Examples are Fishermen (score 1 point for each settlement adjacent to water), Miners (score 1 point for each settlement adjacent to a mountain, or Lords (12 points for the largest settlement in each quadrant, 6 points for the next largest). You receive a terrain card at the beginning of the game that tells you which terrain type you must build 3 mandatory settlements on. Once you complete this, you discard your terrain card and draw a new one for your next turn's mandatory placement. Note that terrain cards are always kept secret until it you turn them face-up on your turn for the other players to see.The game board consists of four quadrants per game; you choose these from a variety of interlocking hexagonal map boards each featuring different terrain configurations and locations. Each map contains the following terrain types: desert, flower-fields, forest, grass (all open for your settlements), and two invalid terrain types: mountains and water. They also contain two or more locations: one or two castles (you score 3 points if you build a settlement next to one), and one or two of the following: barn, farm, harbor, oasis, oracle, stables, and tavern. You will place two location token on each of these (except the castles, but see Capitals rules, below for an exception). The first player to build a settlement adjacent to a location receives one token, which gives a movement and/or settlement placement bonus action each turn. For example, the paddock (stables) is easily the best one, as it allows you to move a preexisting settlement up to two hexes away in any direction and lets you bypass location, settlements, and impassable terrain (mountains, water). The harbor allows you to move one preexisting settlement onto a water hex (which may be useful for meeting other scoring conditions, but scores no points with the Fishermen victory card mentioned above). The oasis lets you place one settlement onto any desert hex you are already adjacent to, and the farm lets you do the same, only with grass. The others are slightly more complicated, so I won't go into them here, but you get the general idea. You want as many of these tokens as you can get, because you can use their bonus actions every turn either before or after your mandatory settlement placement. The more settlements you can move and/or place each turn, the more points you can score, and the faster you can end the game. Note that you can only get a token once from each location, so it's less of an issue in a 2-player game, but with 3 or more players and only 2 of each location token available, someone can get really hurt.The first player to run out of settlements initiates the end game (the other players each get one last turn). All points are tallied up at the end of the game. Scoring is often remarkably close, so you never want to assume you've won. The game is deceptively simple yet incredibly sophisticated, and has a lot of replay value. There's a reason it won the 2012 game of the year award. The designer, Donald X. Vaccarino, also created Dominion, another game of the year award winner.Sounds simple, right? Well, you can't just build on any old terrain matching your card if you have preexisting settlements built on or adjacent to the terrain on your terrain card. You must build on the terrain specified on your card if you can, thus connecting your settlements. Usually, this is a bad idea that cheats you out scoring points or getting other bonuses. You generally want to minimize how many settlements you must build in any one area. So building in a terrain type that has the smallest number of hexes is almost always a good strategy because then if you draw that terrain type again (very likely), you can select a different set of that same terrain on another part of the game board. The reason to be in different areas on the board is to 1) fulfill victory card conditions (like building next to cities, or along water, or next to mountains, or in a straight line, etc.), or 2) to get next to one of the cool location tokens that give you special powers on your turn. Once you understand the game board, you'll begin to see why playing the game requires a lot of clever strategizing.VARIANT HOUSE RULES: Some folks knock this game for its bad luck factor. You may keep drawing terrain cards you don't want or need, or never draw the ones you do. There are two easy house rule fixes to this: 1) Each player draws two terrain cards on their turn and must keep one. The other is discarded to the bottom of the deck (but both cards are still kept secret from the other players), or 2) If you draw the same type of terrain card as your last turn and don't want it, you may reveal and discard it and draw a new one. You may keep doing this until you draw a terrain card that is different from your last one. A tougher variant on this house rule would be that you must keep the second card instead, no matter if it the same (and in this case, you would not reveal the card to the other players until your next turn). Using either of these house rules is guaranteed to fix the bad luck issue that seems to be one of the main criticisms of this otherwise excellent game.There is a&nbsp;<a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/Kingdom-Builder-Nomads-Expansion-1-Board-Game/dp/B00720LXHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8>Kingdom Builder Nomads Expansion 1 Board Game</a>&nbsp;expansion. It adds 40 red settlements so you can expand the game to five players, 3 new victory cards (that let you score points in-game instead of at the end), new location tokens, and new terrain maps. See my review for details.You can also order two exclusive mini-expansions from BGG. The first is called Kingdom Builder: Capitals. It gives you two new Capital city tokens that fit over two of the preexisting castles on the maps. The rules for them say that you use one capital if you are playing with either the Oracle (stonehenge) or Harbor (warship) objectives, or you use both capitals if you both objectives are in play. Unlike regular castles which only score you 3 points for the first settlement built adjacent, capitals are worth 3 points for the first settlement and 1 point for each additional settlement built within two hexes of the capital (including the first one, as the capital bonus points are scored separately after the castle bonus is determined). I've played a lot of games with the capitals and like them a lot, so much that I miss them when they aren't in play (much like stables). Of course, you could always substitute a penny or some other object for the official capital markers.The second BGG exclusive is Kingdom Builder: Caves. It gives you two Cave tokens that you can place on any two mountain hexes to create a tunnel from one area to another. Again, you can use pennies or some other token to represent the caves.

If you're buying for much smaller kid, i would open first and chuck the weapons to be safe.  Great toy!  and very durable for usage by a rough 6yr old. [SEP]"",""[CLS] this is fine. the coveted red power ranger. but my son isn't as into these as i thought (not really at all actually). very small, but as described [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this as a Christmas present for my great nephew, along with all the other power rangers and he loved everyone of them. [SEP]"",""[CLS] My girls love the Power Rangers, and their favorite is usually Jayden.  Jayden is also the leader and he's in every episode without exception.If you collect these little 4-inch action figures for your kid, you probably have to get Jayden.  My girls love him and the other Power Rangers.  It's amazing how this show has won over little kids. [SEP]","[CLS] Each articulated Ranger has a Samurai style with ancient powers making these figures the heroes who protect earth. The Rangers include the Samurai Spin Sword and special unique weapon making the rangers ready to battle! Crafted with great detail and quality, kids and collectors can play or display their favorite figure in their own environment to recreate scenes from the TV show.

Snap together for necklaces or chains, take apart for individual play. My kids love chewing on them too. Very cute and seem indestructible so far. [SEP]"",""[CLS] WE LOVE our snug bugs. easy to throw into the purse and the kid loves these [SEP]"",""[CLS] Bought these as a gift for a friend. My son had these and we gave them to my nephew. These bugs are great for fine motor practice as a toddler, but also good teethers for babies! [SEP]"",""[CLS] These are cute, wish they were easier to put together / take apart [SEP]"",""[CLS] We got this toy for our soon to be born daughter.  I unpacked it and instantly our 3 year old wanted to check them out.  She loves pop beads which will be disappearing once the baby arrives.  She had fun playing with these but I did notice she had to really use some muscle when putting them together and taking them apart.  So most likely she will be helping baby sis put them together and take them apart until she gets the strength to do so herself.  My one complaint was the packaging of this product.  Not only were the bugs tied down but the the box flaps were secured down also.  I spent about 10 minutes freeing the little critters from the packaging.  Hopefully they will figure out a better way to package this in the future. [SEP]"",""[CLS] bought these for the new baby - not yet here - but the 2yo insisted I open up the package and loves to play with them. She's gotten the hang of pulling them apart and putting them back together (with assistance). I think they'll be good for the new baby to teeth on - they have lots of textures and are visually appealing. [SEP]"",""[CLS] These are as cute as the picture shows.  The plastic is soft and colorful and should keep my grabby little one busy for at least a few minutes.  Maybe more. [SEP]","[CLS] The B. Snug Bugs are brightly-colored insect friends that can be strung together or played with apart. These soft snug bugs are make of non-toxic plastic, and are meant to be squeezed, squished, chewed and loved. This set includes nine (9) buggy plastic friends to play with. Each bug is approximately 3-inches in length, perfect for small grabbing hands. The snug bugs come in a 100% recyclable box. [SEP]",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51emVJRbMXL.jpg
B005DX7UHK,"[CLS] We've enjoyed these blocks at our house. They stack nicely, they fall nicely, and when you throw one, you don't break anything. They smelled a tad strong coming out of the package, that's about the only bad thing I can say. The blocks have nice designs on them, they come in a variety of shapes, and they don't come in obnoxious colors. They also squeak when you squeeze them, which, with my kids, is a major plus. [SEP]"",""[CLS] We have the number blocks like these and all of my kids, ages 2-9 enjoy playing with them! (The 9-yr old mostly just plays with the 2yr old when she plays with them, but still...). They stack easily, have great textures, combine well with the letter blocks, and don't hurt if they're thrown at you...what more can you ask! Love the convenient zippered storage pouch with handle...perfect for the toddler to haul around. They are our go-to for church...gives her a quiet activity to entertain her for the majority of the service. They do squeak a bit when you squeeze them but otherwise they are a great quiet time activity. Fantastic buy...love B. stuff! Highly recommend! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Fantasticly cool shapes & great educational tool for years to come. Great diaplay/array of animals & letters on blocks! 8 month old isn't too interested yet but I bought them for the long haul! [SEP]"",""[CLS] Not sure what is so exciting about these blocks, but ALL my kids are just drawn to them.  My 8yr, 6yr, 4yr and 1yr old all enjoy playing and building with these blocks.  They are soft and squishy (like a squeeky toy), and they're made in a way that makes it easy for kids to balance and build successfully.  We have this set, and the set of 10 cubes.  Totally recommend and is the perfect 'go to' gift for a 1-2yr old. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this as a gift for a friend's baby, and wish I had bought one for my own as well. They are very well made, fun for babies to grasp, attractive, very colorful, and easy to store and stack. [SEP]"",""[CLS] These blocks are colorful and soft and they come in many different shapes and sizes. My kids (twins who are 16 months old) stack it up and knock it down again. They love doing that. The blocks can be chewed on and thrown around too! Very suitable for kids around 1-3 years old. My kids are yet to appreciate the different alphabets and animals carved on it, perhaps they need to be a little older. However, if you are looking for something your kids can freely play with without it falling apart, you have found the perfect toy! [SEP]"",""[CLS] I got these blocks to give as a birthday present and I liked them so much that I ended up buying a set for my daughter.  She has the set of ten, and with the addition of this set, now has 36 blocks to play with.  There are several things that make these blocks great:1. They are soft---which means that when they're thrown (as they inevitably will be) they don't cause damage2. They squeak---this may be more interesting to your animals than it is to your child3. They are nontraditional colors---I like the variation from the typical primary colors seen in most toys4. They are nontraditional shapes---there are several shapes included which makes the building more fun5. Each block has a letter of the alphabet and an animal to match it---for example, E for Elephant.  I like how the animals are molded into the blocks and there is no paint or stickers on the blocks6. When given as a gift, the bag makes for a nice presentation.I love these blocks, and my toddler does too.  I see myself giving them as gifts in the future.  My toddler did not show a lot of interest in her initial set of 10 B. blocks until I added this set to it. [SEP]","[CLS] The B. Elemenosqueeze blocks are specially designed for little hands and curious minds. Each hand-sculpted block is an educational and tactile experience - it features a letter of the alphabet, as well as a different animal for each letter. The set includes 26 blocks with relief images of the letters A-Z to delight and educate your little one. Chew on them, toss them in the tub, play with them wherever you want! Build your masterpieces and learn the alphabet along the way. Ages 6 months and up. [SEP]",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41hEwp1LhuL.jpg

The concept is really fun and I wish the manufacturers would have though about this before they mass produced it [SEP]"",""[CLS] We purchased this for our nephew for christmas. It is so adorable. The skillet really looks like a skillet and the fish is plastic and durable. We were so worried it would be cheap and flimsy but this is not the case! We are so excited about this that we are going to get one for our daughter for her birthday!

Now, there won't be anymore of that:) [SEP]"",""[CLS] I bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter for her birthday. She played with it and liked it. She didn't care that the fish was too big for the pan. Her 6 and 7 year old sisters played with it too. I bought it together with several other Campfire Kids toys for pretend camping. I don't think it would receive much attention without the pretend fire log. It's an accessory to the other Campfire toys. They enjoyed playing with it. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I got this for my daughter for her birthday, she really likes it. I think the only thing that I would change would to make the fish smaller or the pan bigger so that the fish could fit in the pan. As how it is now, the fish is a little big and doesn't lay flat in the pan.

B005EFVFT6,"[CLS] Beautiful little dice bag. I use it to carry my Cthulhu dice and sanity markers. [SEP]"",""[CLS] The description when I purchased this claimed I was buying 2 bags.  One arrived.  I was in need of a gift, and really didn't know what I'd do with the other bag anyway, so I kept the bag, but I was a little upset.The bag quality is average at best.  The bag is on the small size too, so it can handle one set of dice well, but don't expect to put much more in it.  Overall, buy this only if you need a Cthulhu bag.  Otherwise, you can do better. [SEP]"",""[CLS] I ordered this bag to go with my copy of Fantasy Flight Games' Eldritch Horror.  It looks beautiful and the eldritch sign really adds a fun new competent to the game, as I use it primarily for blind monster draws.  I was disappointed, however, when on its second use the stings fell out, not easily replaced.  For the price I paid it just seems a little shoddy.  I wish I'd read more reviews before I picked it up.  To paraphrase the President of the United Federation of Planets in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, Save your money, save yourselves.  Avoid this bag at all costs. [SEP]"",""[CLS] Okay I have mostly bad things to say about this dice bag, althoug I like Q-Workshop products in General.Pros: I like the bright green color of the printing. That's about it.Cons: The printing is cheaper than that of the printing on the cream linen bag from the same company. It seems like an iron on that might peel off over time. It's small. VERY small, in fact TOO small for me. You can fit about 15 standard six siders in one of these bags. That's it. Maybe you can cram in one or two more...WITH A HAMMER! It seems like it is made of a felty material that might wear out over time. Time will tell. I would have preferred black linen. (As advertised?)I would eagerly pay ten to twenty USD for a much larger linen dice bag from Q-Workshop. Say, one that holds maybe 30 dice? I bought two of these bags at a much lower price than what it is currently listed at. The list price at the time I bought it was $7.95. Somehow it is now $25.99?!? Current Selling price is $8.50.

B005EG07WG,"[CLS] This model is pretty nice and just what I expected from this manufacturer that set industry standards for MANY years. I'm sorry for all the people who didn't like this model.  I've built kits for 60+years and this Revell model is a LARGE step forward.  It is beyond what Revell and their new acquisition Monogram used to produce.  Little flash, parts fit tight (Put the bottom wing on FIRST before fitting the tops and you eliminate a lot of the complaints).  The decals are so far beyond what Revell and Monogram produced in the past years.  I am, however, mystified about the several double applications required.  They couldn't have them printed all at once? [SEP]"",""[CLS] I like this kit, especially as it is NOT the old Monogram kit that had both canopy variations with different turtlebacks.
